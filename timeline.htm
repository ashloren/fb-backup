I also love how they say arrests of illegal immigrants are up 43% from this time last year, but yet deportation has gone DOWN.

Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world. Yet they pledge to open more camps to help these refugees. And the United States, along with several other countries, think they are too good to have the same decency.

I recently read a horrific story about a large group of Rohingya who were stranded on a boat with a failed motor for an absurd amount of time AT SEA, having been turned away by at least one other country whose shore they approached. Yes, they were given food...and then threatened  by the same people that they would be shot if they came ashore there and their boat was pushed away!

This is BULLSHIT.

Praise to the Indonesian fisherman (a regular person and not a fucking government, you should take note of) who saw them in the water and went back for help, rescuing the entire boat full of desperate and stranded people who were simply fleeing mass violence and ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 27, 2017 at 10:11am PDT</div><div class="comment">http://www.forkfilms.net/pray-the-devil-back-to-hell/

Wade, women&#039;s access to birth control and abortion is still under constant threat. I saw the effect of this in the 2016 election. Reproductive health was rarely mentioned in any of the primary debates, and when it was mentioned, it was often because I brought it up. I was dismayed when Bernie Sanders dismissed Planned Parenthood as just another part of &quot;the establishment&quot; when they endorsed me over him. Few organizations are as intimately connected to the day-to-day lives of Americans from all classes and backgrounds as Planned Parenthood, and few are under more persistent attack. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s &quot;establishment&quot; about that, and I don&#039;t know why someone running to be the Democratic nominee for President would say so.

After the election, Bernie suggested that Democrats should be open to nominating and supporting candidates who are anti-choice. Other topics, such as economic justice, are sacrosant, but apparently women&#039;s health is not. I don&#039;t mean to to criticize only Bernie here — a lot of progressives join him in thinking that reproductive rights are negotiable. And to be clear, I believe there&#039;s room in our party for a wide range of personal views on abortion. I&#039;ve been working for a quarter century with Democrats and Republicans alike to reduce the number of abortions, in part by expanding access to birth control and family planning, and we&#039;ve made progress. And I picked as my running mate Tim Kaine, a Democrat personally opposed to abortion because of his Catholic faith but supportive of women&#039;s rights as a matter of law and policy...And remember: it&#039;s a constitutional right as defined in Roe v. Wade.&quot;

I&#039;ll start with a particularly funny one that all my work from home friends will appreciate.

MANY moons ago (when I was like 18) I got some email with an offer through Yahoo (yes, it was that long ago lol) for buying a domain.

I had never bought or owned one before this, mind you.

I didn&#039;t even know what I was supposed to do after buying one. I really had no idea how any of it worked, but I was intrigued. 

Also, it was cheap as shit.

So I start trying to think of a domain I might want to buy.

I was so naive at this point in time, that my first choice was codependent.com.

It didn&#039;t even occur to me that it was probably already taken, LOL.

I thought it was soooo clever...

Code Dependent...codependent, get it?

Yeah, it wasn&#039;t available (no shit).

Then I noticed it said you could use hyphens in a URL, which I hadn&#039;t known.

Since I was dumb enough to think that it might have been available, you can bet I didn&#039;t grasp any of the more nuanced rules involving the use of hyphens in a URL...

Most importantly, that they should be used sparingly and really you shouldn&#039;t ever have more than one in a single domain.

Alas, the only thing I tried that was available was my original idea, but with hyphens separating EACH goddamn letter.

Yes, I&#039;m serious.

c-o-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t.com

Was my first ever domain. LOL

No wonder it was available, right?

A quick search just now shows that d-u-m-b-a-s-s.com is also available. Doesn&#039;t mean you should buy it though. ;)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 12, 2017 at 10:48pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Hidden Express.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 12, 2017 at 8:54pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Any help from friends is appreciated. &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Just donated to a woman going door to door on behalf of Environment Oregon.

As a sort of experiment, I just hit the record button on my microphone about an hour ago and started to talk into it.

My original intention was to tell a specific story about something important that happened in my life a long time ago...but since I tend to ramble a bit and get long winded, I&#039;ve so far only made it as far as the backstory.

I&#039;m right up to the point where the ACTUAL story I want to tell has been set up and I can dive into the good stuff...

I have no real idea what I would end up doing with this, if anything. I mean, it&#039;s just my voice. There are no visuals at this time...

Was wondering if anyone cared to take a listen and give me feedback on what I have recorded so far? 

Right now, it&#039;s about 36 minutes long...

Need to know if it&#039;s awful or if ANYONE (regardless of sanity or lack thereof) is enticed enough to listen in on the next part (the actual, main story I set out to tell)?

Any takers? If you stop listening, I&#039;d just like to know at what point you turn it off so I can find out where I am losing interest from listeners.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, May 5, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Muahahaha!

I reassured him that this would just be the boring stuff and nothing scary, though I&#039;m not sure he trusted me 100%.

Everything was in tip-top shape! I was shocked to find out that he has even lost a bit of the extra weight they want him to lose (although not sure it qualifies as a milestone).

I blame it on genes. I mean, look at his mother. Not like anyone in this family is underweight or anything, if you know what I&#039;m saying.

Only area where he was docked a few points was in dental health, which is a common problem in smaller breeds. He had his teeth cleaned a few years ago and next checkup she wants to do another blood test to be sure his heart is in good condition since we discovered he has a very mild heart murmur a year ago or so.

If that comes back clean as a whistle, then it will be time for him to have another teeth cleaning! I think I will tell him about this when he wakes up from it though, or I&#039;ll never hear the end of it.

He will give me so much shit about the fact that I refuse to see a dentist despite the ill effects of my own declining dental health, and as a parent I just don&#039;t need that shit! ;)

He&#039;s 10 1/2 years old, the little fucker is not allowed to die. EVER. We&#039;ve been over this more times than either of us can count. I always try to stress the part about how I&#039;m not trying to put any pressure on him with my unrealistic expectations or anything, but firmly explain that he is simply NOT allowed to die. Ever. At all. Period.

He just rolls his eyes and nods and everything else kids do when they have bat shit crazy mom&#039;s who like repeating themselves constantly.

Okay, I learned a lot in this article. I don&#039;t give a fuck about this cunt in particular, she&#039;s just another idiot with too much money and influence.

BUT - I will start by saying that I think public schools beyond what is taught in the first few grades, is a TOTAL and COMPLETE failure and should NOT be mandatory. Period.

That being said, I&#039;m not sure what the big fucking problem is with the idea of for-profit charter schools since this country is JUST FINE with for-profit post secondary education.

Why are profit seeking universities and colleges okay, but not charter schools for younger students?

On the bright side, the only good thing that was included in this article is that charter schools seem to perform at about the same level as most public schools.

So...education wise, it doesn&#039;t sound like kids are really suffering any huge loss or whatever.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, February 10, 2017 at 3:58am PST</div><div class="comment">Wow, as if I&#039;m not already weird and lonely enough, right?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, February 9, 2017 at 2:04am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana published a note.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, February 8, 2017 at 8:03pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana likes a review on Goodreads.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, February 8, 2017 at 3:46am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, February 7, 2017 at 8:00pm PST</div><div class="comment">WTF happened to Bluestacks?

Hmm, seemed like an odd time to do that given that we hadn&#039;t exchanged any heated differences of opinions recently and at first I shrugged it off

Later in the day, another friend of mine (who is not a fan of E Brian Rose) informed me that he had been seeing posts from him throughout the day (after I&#039;d been blocked) where he was: 

*** Clearly mocking the women who were marching and protesting (while somehow seeming to be unable to even refer to them as &#039;women&#039; in any of these posts)

*** Deleting a woman&#039;s comment that it was &quot;her body, her choice&quot; and then explaining it to her by saying &quot;my wall, my choice&quot; (Guess he has to settle for censoring women since he disagrees so strongly with the Supreme Court when it comes to women&#039;s reproductive rights)

Well, I guess that answers that question now, doesn&#039;t it?!

Guess his balls just weren&#039;t big enough to start bashing on women and women&#039;s rights anywhere within my field of vision.

Can you really blame him? I certainly can&#039;t.

I almost feel like he did it for me, knowing I would purge my account of him if I saw things that gross popping up in my newsfeed from him. I guess he figured if he did it first, I might just never hear or see what he was saying.

Oh yeah, and about that last post there...

*** &quot;When you ask them to explain their position, man they get pissed.&quot;

I guess his solution to getting mad at people who question him is to just block them before he starts saying fucked up things about them or a group they belong to.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, January 21, 2017 at 6:20am PST</div><div class="comment">http://www.wweek.com/news/city/2017/01/20/protesters-burn-american-flag-in-pioneer-courthouse-square-as-portland-braces-for-anti-trump-marches/

In fact, they were complete losers on both sides. Selfish, violent, abusive and NEVER concerned with what was best for me or my younger sister.

Which is why I consider myself SO lucky to have been raised by two of the best people I have ever known - my grandparents.

They raised me as if I were their 5th daughter and as a young child, I never felt like I was any different than the kids I went to school with or befriended. They took me in as an infant and they have always been &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; to me (and still are).

This is my mother, Patricia Williams. She was the one who held me as a child when I couldn&#039;t sleep in the middle of the night because I always seemed to have another ear infection. She&#039;d hold me, rock me, try to soothe me with her voice. She&#039;d stay up with me until I finally fell asleep again.

She was the one who stayed at home with me when I was little while my grandfather ran his car dealership. She cooked nearly every meal we ate, every day of every year.

When it was time to start the new school year, she would take me shopping to buy my supplies and new clothes. She was always there to play the part of &quot;mom&quot; in whatever way I would need her to, my whole life.

Only in hindsight do we look back and realize how difficult it must have been for our parents to do all the things they could be counted on to do for us. Conveniently, it was around the same time I fully realized how much grief I surely caused her through the years LOL.

My grandparents have been married over 50 years and still going strong. I just don&#039;t know what would have happened to me if I hadn&#039;t known that they would be there for me whenever I needed their help and their love.

Even if we are very different (and trust me, WE ARE!) from each other, we somehow manage to set things aside when more important things come up. 

Now that I&#039;m nearly 30 years old, I have a profound respect for my parents. Especially as someone who has never wanted to have any kids of my own or &#039;start a family.&#039; I also can&#039;t IMAGINE how two people can possibly stay together for over 50 years and still love each other. I know I certainly couldn&#039;t.

Thank you, mom and dad. You are the only people I have ever really thought of as my &#039;family,&#039; and yet you have been more than enough for me. &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 4:06pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared 13 WHAM ABC&#039;s video.<div class="comment">L.O.L!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 9:30am PST</div><div class="comment">http://www.ashlylorenzana.com/wp-content/uploads/selfies.gif

Okay, it&#039;s up to the wire, folks. I&#039;m not sure what we can do here, but I&#039;ve spent four hours trying to make it easy, so please, if you&#039;re willing to spend 3 minutes to copy and paste, do it, and lets see if the weirdest election in our history can get little weirder.

There&#039;s a blog, &quot;Flip the 37,&quot; that did a great job of culling a complete list of all the electors. Problem is, they didn&#039;t make it easy. Each elector is listed individually, some with emails, some without, and there&#039;s no way of knowing which is a Democratic Elector, and which a Republican. Still, good work, and thanks all around. Kudos.
I took their list, and copied and pasted it into a text doc that you can copy and paste into the &quot;To&quot; part of your email. Here are all the names:

As a subject line, I&#039;d suggest, &quot;Please think before you vote for Trump on Monday&quot;

We&#039;re trying to turn 37 GOP electors away from Trump toward another Presidential nominee. They&#039;re simply not going to vote for HRC, so you can urge them to vote for a moderate Republican, as the Hamilton Electors suggest; or, you can make your own suggestion.

This is what Flip the 37 suggests (and you can, of course, edit at will):
Dear [Elector],

I&#039;m writing to you to encourage you to decline to cast your electoral vote for Donald Trump. Over the course of his career, as well as this election, he has proven himself to be unfit for the role of commander-in-chief. He has displayed disregard not only for multiple groups of Americans, but for our country itself.

His close ties to Russia, his volatile temperament, his lack of experience, and his bigotry are not qualities that we want representing us to the rest of the world. We do not believe that he represents the views of the majority of the American people, regardless of political affiliation. Additionally, he lost the popular vote by the most significant margin in history.

Please consider casting your vote for another candidate, or abstaining from voting entirely. As a representative of the people, you have a responsibility to listen to your constituents, and millions of us have spoken: do not elect Donald Trump to the White House.
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your name]</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 5:35am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana added a temporary profile picture.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 5:24am PST</div><div class="comment">PLEASE...if you consider yourself my friend and care about fairness and believe in the concept of voting and electing our President.

This is a nifty list someone has taken the time to put together which lists all contact information for the electors all over the country who will be voting on December 19th...it even has notes for some of them, indicating that they have publicly expressed concerns over voting for Trump.

Hey, assholes...

How would you like it if the government came along and told you that you couldn&#039;t have any children or start a family of your own? Would you like that?

THEN STOP trying to force it on other people who DO NOT want the same things you do, ya dig?

I have no right to tell you that you can&#039;t have children.

You have no right to tell me I should have to just because I wind up with an unintended pregnancy.

If you are &quot;pro-life&quot; and think abortion is wrong, you would think that supporting easy and affordable access to birth control pills would be an idea you could get behind, right?

I guess not. Religious groups don&#039;t want to pay for insurance which would cover the costs of birth control either.

I guess that makes sense if you believe the only reason a woman should be allowed to have sex is if she is trying to have babies. 

But it&#039;s funny how you NEVER hear them protest paying for insurance that covers fucking Viagra for men. Hmmmm.......

Considering how many of those they typically prescribe per bottle, I&#039;d almost have to say that they think it&#039;s perfectly fine for a guy to be trying to knock up a handful of women every fucking month.

But Hillary Clinton is definitely still Satan because a few ambassadors willingly traveled to an unstable and potentially dangerous part of the world during her time as Secretary of State and ended up dying there.

That won&#039;t win either though, so they should both just drop out of the race. After all, offering two candidates in each Presidential election (two that have any chance at all of winning, that is) is just to create the illusion that the people are given a choice. We are not.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 12:45am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared Kimberly Brink - Castleberry&#039;s post.<div class="comment">OMG, I woke up my sleeping dog when I started laughing out loud at this.

They don&#039;t want you to love them. They don&#039;t want your friendship, your support, your help.

Sometimes those people take all those things from you anyway and when you finally have to accept that they don&#039;t want them from you, it feels pretty fucking awful.

The last time I heard from Caliban Darklock was on July 22nd. I wrote him an email you can see in the screenshot included here. 

He responded with four words.

I don&#039;t like to bug people who don&#039;t seem to want to talk much, but when you love someone that can be difficult.

I wrote him twice in August with words of encouragement and love, which you can see from our chat history in the second screenshot. 

When a mutual friend of ours told me they were chatting online with him and he seemed well, I figured he must just not want to talk to ME, specifically for some reason.

So I wrote him again in late September, which you can see in the chat screenshot as well.

Now the date is October 4th, two days after my birthday. And I finally hear from him.

This is what he has to say: &quot;I just never have anything to say that I think you&#039;d want to hear.&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 7:36pm PDT</div><div class="comment">I  mean, this is after the man claims to have been paid $213,606,575 for The Apprentice.

The only complaint I had about the film was his awful fake accent. I&#039;m sorry, I felt like it was kind of painful every time he spoke in it. lol

It doesn&#039;t mean she&#039;s dying. It doesn&#039;t mean she has some terminal illness. It just means she is sick and will recover in the near future. I&#039;m surprised people need this explained to them.

I find it somewhat ironic that her character&#039;s delight in manipulating men with her sexual charms in order to get ahead was so over the top that even I couldn&#039;t help but laugh and shake my head at the same time.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/28/coddled-students-and-their-safe-spaces-arent-the-problem-college-official-says-bigots-are/

I&#039;ll admit, I&#039;m somewhat split on this issue. 

On the one hand, you cannot disagree with the title of this piece because it is TRUE. Bigots certainly ARE the bigger of the two issues, in my opinion. 

However, I also tend to side with the majority of comments to this article, which essentially say: &quot;The world is full of offensive shit and being unable to deal with that will leave you pathetic and helpless.&quot;

Yes, totally. Two men playing tennis, cards or eating together at a restaurant would have made all the fucking difference here.

Instead, we are forced (by who?) to see two men, fully fucking clothed and in minimal physical contact with one another in a reclined position looking way too wholesome to ever think of a sexual thing of any kind.

I mean, fuck. They might as well have used a fucking closeup shot of a man&#039;s penis moving in and out of another man&#039;s anus. 

And this is coming from a group of people with the word &#039;family&#039; in their fucking stupid name. I&#039;m pretty sure you start families BY FUCKING HAVING SEX.

And yeah, everyone else in this situation has done something WRONG because the sex they never even had or made you watch (so a concept in no way actually depicted here or even really suggested) WAS THE WRONG FUCKING KIND AND YOU DON&#039;T LIKE THAT KIND OF SEX.

Being gay isn&#039;t the only risk factor for &#039;being yourself.&#039;

In fact, as far as persecuted groups of people go, you have it somewhat easy because you have the personal choice of making your sexual orientation known or keeping it private, thus basically opting out of homophobic persecution. 

It isn&#039;t so easy for blacks and other races who are on the end of unfair treatment and racism, is it now?

Just because I&#039;m a straight, white person doesn&#039;t AT ALL mean you should assume that I risk nothing to be myself.

I&#039;m both openly a drug addict and a prostitute.

Quoted directly from said discussion: 

&#039;So Justin asked for my help in answering one simple question: How can I further my spiritual progress in becoming the most giant of all douche fountains on this planet?

I gave it about thirty seconds of thought as I stood there staring at him blankly and mulling over the depth of his unexpected and soul-searching plea.

I suggested we put a totally meaningless tattoo directly onto his nozzle, to really bring out his inner douche and since he didn&#039;t care what the tattoo ended up being, it&#039;s naturally something totally meaningless.

In fact, I don&#039;t even remember what it is and I&#039;m the one who did it for him. *giggle*&#039;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 3:31pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana and Vanessa Blais are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:31pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Yo, I know it&#039;s probably a bit of a long shot but it can&#039;t hurt to ask...

Of course, this is a brilliant cash cow for the company who makes them...but not so much for the consumer.

Hearing is scheduled for 9AM tomorrow. If they don&#039;t grant the motion to dismiss (unlikely) then the trial will take place afterwards and should be over by the end of the day.

If we lose (likely) that means I&#039;ll be in jail tomorrow night.

I&#039;ve been fasting for over 24 hours and plan to do so until I&#039;m released. It&#039;s funny because after a day, you don&#039;t even feel hungry anymore. It&#039;s not as bad as I thought it would be.

Went to Planned Parenthood yesterday and got me some morning after pills to interrupt certain events which would be less than pleasant to deal with in jail. Seems to have worked.

Wish me luck, I will need all of it that I can get.

Remember, I have asked the DA twice for a straight time offer rather than probation with less time in jail. Twice it has been refused.

Eriks Berzins, the DA&#039;s lapdog, thinks that doing the time for the crime isn&#039;t &quot;taking accountability&quot; for the horrible crime of simple drug possession.

I agree with the guy about everything except for the part where he says that addicts can&#039;t stand to be present in their own lives. I&#039;m perfectly fine with being present for mine and, in fact, it helps me spend more of it awake instead of lethargic and unconscious.

I would just like to go on record as saying that if you ever find yourself hanging out with two tweakers in an RV with all the windows busted out of it at 3AM with an extension cord running to the nearest building....

It&#039;s probably not a good idea to let them start a tattoo of your exes face on your body.

While we can&#039;t all work to correct every injustice that exists in this world, we CAN be supportive of and understanding to those people who ARE working to right the many different wrongs.

We don&#039;t have to sit back and sneer in our apathy simply because we are untouched by the ugliness that affects others in the world.

Stop it, please. Start caring. Start noticing. Start recognizing the efforts of others and start doing whatever small things you can to show your support for the things you feel are right.

Dr. Tiller was murdered in 2009 while attending church.

It was pretty sad to learn that the majority of late term abortions are couples who wanted a child and found out late in the pregnancy that something was very wrong with the fetus. 

Most of the patients seen in the documentary were dealing with fetal abnormalities that were fatal and even if they had the child, it would almost certainly be dead within a few years of being born.

Not to mention, they would suffer considerably until that happened. 

There were also a couple patients who just couldn&#039;t afford another child and wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and the doctor made the VERY valid point of saying she was in no position to turn away some patients and not others, just because one had a dramatic story and the other didn&#039;t.

Until about a week ago, the last book I read cover to cover was &quot;1984&quot; and that was over 10 years ago when I was just seventeen, lol.

&quot;Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery&quot; by Robert Kolker was hard to put down! I read the whole thing in about 24 hours. I highly recommend it.

It is a testament to how little of a shit law enforcement and most of society gives about prostitutes who are murdered.

If you have thousands, probably not.

If you have 50, there&#039;s a good chance you might be able to.

But I have 200, and I was curious if I could do this.

The short answer is technically no.

Although I stopped accepting every friend request I received a looong time ago, there are still probably a couple dozen people in my friends list who I have never interacted with.

I&#039;ll admit that having mutual friends with someone makes it harder for me to ignore a friend request, in most cases.

That being said, I took a look at the group I created years ago for those I consider &quot;Close Friends&quot; here on FB and I&#039;m happy to say that of that list, I was able to give at least one good reason for why I like them as a person.

If you are surprised to not find yourself tagged in this post, please bear in mind that I didn&#039;t include everyone for a few reasons. This list is mostly friends, rather than family (with one very special exception).

Another possible reason is that I may have felt the details of our friendship were simply too personal for a public FB post without first getting clearance.

So here we go!

====================================================

Jocelyn VandeBerg - Your no nonsense attitude may bother some people, but I think they are out of touch with reality and need just the kind of tough love you would dish out. :) 

I think you and I could have endless hours of fun just talking about people who need to toughen the fuck up. lol

Jeff Fischer - I never thought I&#039;d find anyone on the planet who swears more than I do or anyone as unapologetic about their swearing as I am. Then I met Jeff! ;) 

Your posts always crack me the fuck up, we both seem to think the world should pretty much just go fuck itself and I just want you to know that I support your serious efforts to help others with mental illnesses get the help they need too.

(Cynthia Renee Chesser is one lucky woman for snagging Jeff, and she is also a wonderful person. I hope I&#039;m invited to their wedding! ;) )

Tiffany Bechert - I love the fact that your responses are as long as they are whenever we have chatted. You are an introvert, like me. 

The way you convey your thoughts through writing reminds me very much of my own &#039;stream of consciousness&#039; style. 

You are more thoughtful than most of the people on the planet and your self-awareness is also exceptional. Your support means the world to me. &lt;3

Katie Berra - I&#039;m a huge fan of yours, Katie. You are everything a woman should be --- strong, determined, hard-working, a wonderful mother, sassy and full of attitude! 

Emily McCollum - For the past several years, you have reminded me a lot of myself when I was your age. 

You call it like it is and you don&#039;t let friends or family off the hook when you feel something isn&#039;t right. I love that about you. You are strong, outspoken and also beautifully kind. 

I love you, little cuz. 

Anna Larsen - It&#039;s rare to connect with anyone as uplifting as Anna is. Every conversation we&#039;ve had has left me feeling better, empowered and she truly believes in me. 

It&#039;s refreshing also to find someone else who doesn&#039;t feel the need or desire to have children, like myself. 

Plus, Anna is insanely ambitious and if you need fitness or dieting guidance, I highly recommend getting in touch with her. 

Joel Hansen - Joel has the unique distinction of being my only FB friend who has ever called me &#039;naive,&#039; albeit somewhat jokingly. ;) 

Even if I&#039;m being called out, I can always appreciate someone who calls it like it is. 

Ti Gwanz - Not only are we fellow Libras, but Ti is the only person who has followed me long enough on multiple platforms to give me credit for my outstanding penchant for taking &#039;selfies&#039; long before they went mainstream and started calling them &#039;selfies.&#039; 

You, sir, are awesome! 

Tiffany Rae Lambert - Another one of the many strong-willed and opinionated women in my list of friends! 

Don&#039;t mess with Tiffany, she will knock you off your virtual feet if she finds out you are using shady business methods or if you are just a common asshole. 

They don&#039;t call her the honey badger for nothing! ;) 

In all seriousness, I have been following Tiff for years since I first encountered her products on the WF. 

If you are a newbie trying to make money online and want to find someone honest who you can trust for marketing advice, Tiffany&#039;s blog is where you need to go. 

Amanda Ami Thomas - I admire the fact that you have managed to identify a group of people you can both relate to and fight for. 

I certainly know how it feels to be judged, mistreated and dismissed because I happen to be in a stigmatized group of people. And I can appreciate the action you have taken to stand up for people who are not treated fairly and offer them help. 

Keep fighting! 

Toby Santamaria - I adore Toby because she is one of the sweetest young women I&#039;ve ever known, which is a stark contrast to a cynical bitch like myself. 

Toby is kind, smart as fuck, passionate and driven to do something important with her life. I admire her determination and only wish I had half as much when I was her age. 

Oh, and it may be stating the obvious but she is drop dead gorgeous too! 

Who would have known that one of Caliban&#039;s ex girlfriends would turn out to be a better friend to me than he has himself, right? 

Alas, she certainly has. 

Melissa Gallinetti - Melissa is one-of-a-kind and I love how she does her own motherfucking thing and has no concern for &#039;fitting in&#039; or being &#039;mainstream.&#039; 

She is a goth princess, if I may say so. ;)

Not only am I tickled to find cool people who may be even stranger than myself in terms of their likes and interests, but Melissa might be the only person on the planet who actually enjoys my (somewhat intentionally) awful karaoke covers! &lt;3 

Can&#039;t wait to meet her when she visits Portland. 

Dexter Abraham - I get a kick of Dexter&#039;s posts because he doesn&#039;t give a single fuck what anyone fucking thinks of him, what he does or the things he says. 

He may even give less fucks than I do, which is no small accomplishment. 

I have a real soft spot for dudes who swear a lot and refuse to apologize for who they are, so I naturally dig his stuff. 

Carry on! 

Tim Castleman - In a similar way, I also love the way Tim Castleman will tell a person to go fuck themselves if they come to him acting like a little sniveling bitch. 

I think it&#039;s funny as fuck when Tim responds to some of the dumb asses who try to trash his products with negative reviews. I would do the same thing, and I have on several occasions. 

I&#039;ll admit, when I first interacted with Tim in a Skype group years ago, I wasn&#039;t sure I liked him. He kind of seemed like an asshole. 

But I was wrong. 

Since then, we&#039;ve become good friends and I would vouch for him any day of the week. He&#039;s got a kind heart and is willing to help anyone who actually puts in the work and wants to succeed. 

He stands out as a refreshing exception to the typical internet marketing scammer rule. 

Lisa Huemer - Lisa is one of the most genuine and fun-loving people I&#039;ve ever known. It can be difficult to convey tones or be convincingly authentic when you only know a person online, but I&#039;ve never ran into that issue with Lisa. 

Since becoming friends, I&#039;ve never once doubted her sincerity and I love her for having a capacity to actually care about others because most people in this world simply do not. 

We also both love Cooking Dash, which is pretty neat. ;) 

On more than one occasion, Lisa has managed to say something that I myself would struggle to find the right words for and it has blown me away. I can only hope we get a chance to someday meet in real life. &lt;3

Amanda Dondelinger - I only wish I had even a fraction of the natural energy that Amanda radiates, but I don&#039;t. 

She is bright, cheerful, positive and yet somehow she is still awesome! For me to think this is some small miracle! ;) 

In all seriousness, she is a very cool lady who loves to help others and if you are interested in dieting and natural remedies, please reach out to her. 

Not only does she have extensive knowledge in these areas, but she is also a blast to talk to and I know she would be an awesome accountability buddy for anyone who struggles to follow through with their health and lifestyle goals.

Mike Halperin - I always think it&#039;s especially cool when two people are able to find common ground and become friends despite being from different generations. 

Not only has Mike been supportive when I released my last book, but he&#039;s probably one of my only FB friends who can honestly say they remember what the world was like before Bic lighters! ;) 

People don&#039;t always have to agree on everything to be friends and I like that Mike and I are different and our opinions don&#039;t always align. What matters is that he is willing to listen to other people and consider what they say, whether he ends up agreeing or not. We need more people who are this reasonable. 

Cyndi McMurrian - I will forever love (and at the same time be genuinely puzzled by) anyone who has read one of my books and felt compelled to reach out to me afterwards, like Cyndi and several other friends in this list did. 

I love Cyndi even more because we are both hardcore fans of Epic Rap Battles of History! ;)

Kimberly J Castleberry - In addition to being smart as hell and awesome at what she does professionally, Kim is special because she truly cares about people. 

I remember when I posted something a long time ago about how depressed I had been (it was really bad, actually) Kim immediately picked up the phone and called me. 

I missed the call, but she left a voicemail offering her support and wanting to make sure I was okay. We didn&#039;t know each other very well, but that didn&#039;t matter to her. 

She just saw someone who was in a lot of pain and feeling hopeless and she didn&#039;t think twice about offering emotional support to them. I will never forget that. 

I also think it&#039;s awesome that she is taking such an active role in her niece&#039;s upbringing because raising children and being a positive influence in their lives is an overwhelming responsibility and I know her niece will be a better person because of her guidance and love.

Nile Flores- Not all of my FB friends are people who I&#039;ve chatted with a lot or who have chosen to reveal as much about themselves as others. 

And that&#039;s 100% okay. Which is why I wanted to make sure and include Nile in this list because she has been supportive of me when I needed it and while she may be more reserved and quiet about things, that doesn&#039;t make me value her as a friend any less. 

She is also awesome for being a tech ninja and reminding us that there are some very talented and successful women in tech industries. 

Rob Delker - Not only is Rob a touchingly sweet and gentle soul, but I am so incredibly jealous whenever he plays his guitar and sings for me. Listening to him play and sing is quite a treat and I&#039;m lucky to know him.

Joe Rutland - Joe is another one of my friends who is on a mission to help certain groups of people who face unique challenges in life. His podcast is wonderful and if you feel like you are entering a mid-life crisis, you NEED to buy and read his recently released book Midpoint! 

Joe is a soft-spoken and gentle guy who is trying to make the world a better place for everyone in his own way, which I think its awesome.

Di DeFries - Di has been another somewhat quiet supporter of mine and she has reached out at critical moments in my life recently when I really needed kindness like she has to offer. &lt;3

Hagar Kelly - Hagar is a wise soul and I love talking with him because nothing I say shocks him or freaks him out. 

In fact, I get the impression that he probably has lots of stories more outrageous than mine, which is impressive. ;) 

He is always willing to answer my weird questions, offer advice, listen to my epic ranting and make me feel better for the interactions. 

I also love reading his long form stories he posts on FB, he is an amazing storyteller and every experience he shares has an important takeaway that resonates with me.

Shane Vozar - I think Shane and I first found each other years ago on the Warrior Forum. Shane is especially cool because he is into stuff that most people would find a little &#039;too weird&#039; or &#039;out there.&#039; 

He&#039;s all about showing love to the underground talent in this world and he has shown support for me and my projects consistently throughout the past several years. &lt;3

Eva-Lynne Norman - Eva and I connected after she read my very first book/journal that I published on Amazon. 

We have shared many of the same experiences in life and also suffered from some of the same misfortunes as well. Neither of us had the love and support we deserved from our closest family growing up and yet her love and the support she has shown for me have helped fill that void in my life since we met years ago. 

In many ways, she is the mother I wished I had when I was growing up and I&#039;d do pretty much anything for her because she has done so much for who I am today. 

She also makes amazing banana bread and chocolate mousse, so I kind of want to hate her a little bit too, haha. ;) 

Andy Beveridge - Not only does Andy make me laugh every time we have chatted, he is also a very understanding guy who I find it easy to relate to. He&#039;s the definition of &#039;chill,&#039; and he has been supportive of my writing and other things that are important to me. &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, March 5, 2016 at 10:02pm PST</div><div class="comment">I have a Samsung #Chromebook from 2012 and I just want to go on the record as saying that 2 fucking gigs of memory is NOT enough. It wasn&#039;t even enough to smoothly run Chrome (since that&#039;s all you&#039;ll be doing with a Chromebook, anyways) back in 2012 when it was released!

As I write this, I have two active tabs open in Chrome (FB and Gmail) and I have exactly ONE app installed (you can find it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/system/ocjnemjmlhjkeilmaidemofakmpclcbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) and according to the app I linked to, that is eating up over 80% of the available 2 gigs of memory. 

#FAIL

What the fuck was Google thinking here? I mean, I can get on board with the whole concept of doing everything in the cloud, but if that&#039;s the revolution they want to make reality then why the fuck would they not enable their devices with enough memory to do more than posting to FB at any given time?

This doesn&#039;t make sense. 

On the plus side, I&#039;ve never had any type of electronic device which has the battery life OR the boot time that this thing does. Not even close.

I&#039;ll tell you from personal experience using my Chromebook that Google&#039;s official specs for the devices are actually modest. The battery life is actually several hours MORE than what they have listed in the specs.

And I say that after using mine for a consecutive TEN HOURS before it finally died, back when I first got it.

Even the boot time they claim seems modest to me by like 1/2 - 1 full second.

But really, the fact that it has a keyboard is the only advantage it has over a damn &quot;smart&quot; phone (anyone who knows me will tell you how much I fucking hate those).

If you want a super shitty user experience using a device barely capable of checking email and posting to FB at the same time, get a fucking piece of shit smartphone. 

I&#039;m sure they have more than 2 gigs of memory.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, March 5, 2016 at 9:33pm PST</div><div class="comment">http://www.ashlylorenzana.com/10-worst-breaking-bad-characters/

Maybe they will even wonder why they have never heard of me before this. They will ask others about me, dropping my name here and there when they think to ask and every time the answer will be confusion and shaking heads.

&quot;Nope. Never heard of her. Who was she?&quot;

They won&#039;t know the answer to that, of course. How could they?

I&#039;ll exist in some distant corner of their mind, only rising to the surface of their memory when some stray thought manages to attach itself to me, creating an association that may or may not make any sense at all.

When that happens, maybe they will smile as the reflect on the words I left behind for someone to find.

Then I&#039;ll fade out again, perhaps for the very last time in that person&#039;s mind.

Maybe their last thought about me is, &quot;what a shame that she lived when no one would listen or consider the things she tried to share with them. If only the world had been ready for her when she was here and could have changed it in some small way.&quot;

For example, I could wear a wife beater in the middle of an Oregon winter (not that I would ever be caught dead in one) and by the time I make it to the end of my street, I&#039;ve broken a sweat.

The insulation I pack around also came in handy when I was driving to California last month because I could turn off my car and sleep for multiple hours in my coat before the cold woke me up and I had to start the engine again.

Stashing cash and dope in my bra is much easier with tits the size of mine, too. 

However, there are some down sides to it as well.

Like when I fell face forward into some gravel a few months back, spraining my ankle and hitting the ground with all those extra pounds. The next day, it felt like someone had kicked the shit out of my ribs and breathing was painful.

Wish me luck, I will need it. My trial is set for the 10th and we have to convince a jury that there is reasonable doubt that I knowingly was in possession of methamphetamine on my arrest date ALMOST A YEAR AGO. So much for a speedy trial, right?

In other words, there is a good chance I am going to jail on the 10th. But don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not going to act remorseful because I&#039;m not. I&#039;m not going to play the probation game either and I will be sure to make these things known during sentencing, in the event that I lose the case.

It&#039;s easy to talk shit until your ass is on the line. But no one ever said it was going to be easy to stay true to yourself and I don&#039;t expect it will be.

They might as well hang me for witchcraft, that makes as much sense. I have no respect for any government that imprisons non-violent people for crimes that involve no victim.

Yeah, those things changed and we don&#039;t do them anymore. I think this is good. But here&#039;s the problem.

At the time when those laws were in place, people either a) Honestly felt it was just, right and the best thing for us to do or b) didn&#039;t know anything else and accepted it, not thinking much of it.

But what about the millions of people who are convicted of drug possession every year (myself very likely included in the near future) who have done nothing to harm anyone?

Fifty years from now, we&#039;ll be the casualties of The War on Drugs and people will say they can&#039;t believe they ever threw people in jail or made them felons over that shit.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, January 1, 2016 at 10:01am PST</div><div class="comment">Happy new year, Ashley!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 31, 2015 at 9:36pm PST</div><div class="comment">In other news, Microsoft admits to being a tattle tail.

If you are a weirdo like me who refuses to use mobile phones now that they are totally gay, but still wants to play mobile games, then Bluestacks is the perfect solution.

It allows you to run mobile apps and games from your PC and while the first version was pretty so-so, this new release is really awesome. 

It&#039;s free, but they will occasionally ask you to either upgrade your account or install a few free apps.

It&#039;s cool because the app installs you agree to rather than paying will not show up in your Bluestacks menu, so you forget they are even there. You can uninstall them right away too, if you want to remove them after.

Every private message you send another person on Facebook is saved in that same thread...if you message someone a lot on here, the thread literally holds thousands of messages back and forth and all you have to do to dig into the past is click on the link that says &quot;Load Older Messages&quot; and they appear.

You can scroll all the waaaaay back to your very first message sent or received from any one particular FB user. 

And every word exchanged since then is THERE.

Once upon a time, it was simply a wonder that you could connect to the web by making the small sacrifice of your phone line and you could send messages back and forth with people all around the world and they would show up instantly (thus, instant messaging is probably an appropriate term).

THAT was amazing. Just that.

There was no feasible method for storing these interactions or conversations you had with others. 

It was just awe-inspiring that you could have them at all, and with such speed and ease.

All of those conversations are gone. Forever. 

Little bits and pieces only continue to exist in your memory and the other person&#039;s...though more often, it is probably just feelings attached to the conversation which you actually remember. 

Not the words.

You can&#039;t go back and look at them again. Ever.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 1:16am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Hi Guess the Brand.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 1:16am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Hi Guess the Food.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 12:24am PST</div><div class="comment">For fuck&#039;s sake, how goddamn long does it take for a newly uploaded Kindle cover to update on the sales page, anyway?!

Yes, this stuff is kind of personal..so don&#039;t read it if that bothers you. If you know me at all, you are already aware that I&#039;m an open book and don&#039;t hold much back.

To say I had high hopes for Caliban&#039;s sudden move up here would be a huge understatement. 

When his living situation in North Carolina fell through without much warning, he simply asked me if I wanted to buy him an airline ticket to Portland so he could be up here with me.

While I wanted to jump out of my chair and scream &quot;YES,&quot; I DID make sure to voice my concerns about practical matters.

As in, I did not have a place of my own where we could stay. I was very upfront with him about this.

He told me his income had taken a big hit recently and that concerned me because I didn&#039;t have much of one at the time myself, which I explained.

I flat out told him that I did not think I could support us both on my own for very long and he claimed to understand the situation.

I just kind of said, &quot;Fuck it, we&#039;ll figure it out somehow!&quot; because duh, I wanted to see him so fucking much that it hurt.

After staying in a shitty motel for the first couple of weeks, the financial strain was becoming too much.

A friend of mine let us move in as roommates and we agreed to cover half of the rent...

Except for I was the only one paying it for the first two months.

I told him I needed his help with rent and other expenses. It&#039;s not like I have a trust fund or something. If I had oodles of cash, none of this shit would matter and I wouldn&#039;t bat an eye at any of it.

But I don&#039;t.

And I&#039;d spent thousands of dollars to get him here and then make sure we had a place to stay and food to eat. I told him I&#039;d had enough and gave my friend notice that I would not be staying there anymore.

Since then, he&#039;s hardly spoken to me. I haven&#039;t seen him (why would I go over there after the way things went down?) and he has vanished from Facebook as well as the other places we used to chat regularly.

I assume since he doesn&#039;t even want to talk to me anymore that our friendship was mostly just a bunch of bull shit.

But I still love him. I still admire him. I still adore him.

I always will.

I don&#039;t think anything can change that.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 9, 2015 at 7:34am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Scribbage.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2:27am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Scribbage.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 9, 2015 at 12:25am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:43pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Scribbage.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 7, 2015 at 2:39pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana updated her cover photo.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 7, 2015 at 2:07pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 7, 2015 at 11:22am PST</div><div class="comment">If you have bangs that cover one eye...you might be an emo kid.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:14am PST</div><div class="comment">Watched Trainwreck last night, it was okay.

Since it seems so easy for this Jenner freak show to shrug off the challenges of &quot;being a woman&quot; (which he is NOT, nor has he spent most of his life pretending to be), he will have to forgive me for not giving a shit which pronoun I use when I refer to his testosterone-leaden comments and for being convinced he has never for one day of his life legitimately &quot;struggled&quot; over any sort of gender identity issue, but appears to instead be a washed up athlete starved for attention and willing to wear dresses if it lands him his own reality TV freak show.

Okay...not that I ever thought I&#039;d find myself defending Sarah Palin of all people...BUT...

I read the above article and found zero wrong with anything she said. She acknowledges the challenge that single parents face and hoped her daughter would have the support of a partner in raising their children...there is nothing wrong with that, in my book.

She also indicates that her daughter is a good parent to her child, so what the hell is wrong with Palin deciding to love her daughter and grandchildren, regardless of whether her daughter is married or not?

News flash: you can&#039;t control what your children decide to do as adults. You can only control how you react...and since having kids out of wedlock is against Sarah Palin&#039;s personal beliefs, I suppose she could choose to react to her daughter&#039;s second pregnancy by disowning her and telling her she will burn in hell.

Is that what people want instead? For her to take the Bible she has faith in and condemn her daughter&#039;s actions?

Well fuck you if that&#039;s what you think would make her more &quot;consistent.&quot;

I don&#039;t give a fuck what you have to tell yourself in order to transcend the narrowness of the common mind in order to love your family and accept them along with their differences.

If she wants to give God credit for giving 100 chances, that&#039;s fine by me. 

It&#039;s always refreshing to open up an article with a hearty eye roll and plenty of bias and finish it with the realization that you are still able to see your own truth in something regardless of who or what it may involve and all your current associations with both.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, November 15, 2015 at 9:45pm PST</div><div class="comment">The more likely headline would read: &quot;American Airlines: Washington, DC, to Boston Flight Evacuated After Paranoia Planted in Heads of American People by Terrorists Clouds Judgement.&quot;

You ever notice just how much damage is done to a person when they never HAVE to actually do anything for themselves or solve their own problems?

A common example of this that I&#039;ve encountered a lot in life so far are people who continue to live at home with their parents well into adulthood...

Most people don&#039;t do that as a first choice, which means they usually NEED the help their parents provide with a place to live, bills being paid, groceries being bought...you know, just normal everyday stuff.

It seems to me that these people get awfully comfortable never having to do these things for themselves and quickly lose all sense of the value of these things. They just grow to expect them, but never at their own cost.

If you can&#039;t pay your current bills or support yourself NOW, then whatever BS &quot;business&quot; you think you are &quot;running&quot; is...well, not fucking working.

Sorry, but that passage from this article totally invalidates the entire thing to me...why does this person think they are unique or that this label even applies to them?

Are they really desperate enough to believe that they are among a select group of females who have sex without a &quot;normal drive&quot; to have it...?

This just seems pretentious and stupid to me, sorry if that offends anyone. The relationship she describes sounds typical to me. She has sex with her significant other, but only when she is willing to...you know, because otherwise that would be fucking rape. 

Most women don&#039;t like sex when they aren&#039;t willing. It&#039;s not the same thing as lacking a strong desire to have it. You&#039;re not special.

Obamacare paid for my abortion. It&#039;s 100% true. 

Before Obamacare, I didn&#039;t have medical insurance. 

After Obamacare, I just had to call a phone number and tell them I had no income (on paper, at least) of any kind and presto! I suddenly had insurance.

It was this insurance (that I pay zero dollars for and which has so far covered everything I have needed, including a four day hospital stay) that paid in full for my ABORTION.

The End.

P.S. If this story makes you upset, I&#039;m glad and fuck you.

Fuck yeah, Bill Nye. 

My rule of thumb: if an issue does not concern you at all and in no way interferes with your health, safety and quality of life then....drum roll...you DO NOT GET AN OPINION ON THAT ISSUE.

Don&#039;t like the idea of gay marriage? Don&#039;t marry someone of the same gender. Problem solved. But you don&#039;t HAVE a say in the matter, as it does not fucking concern you or infringe on your rights.

Same goes for abortion. If you have a penis, you&#039;ll never get an abortion. So you don&#039;t get an opinion on it because that opinion is effectively fucking worthless.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 25, 2015 at 12:29am PDT</div><div class="comment">It&#039;s pretty easy to be &quot;against abortion&quot; if you don&#039;t have a fucking uterus (LOL). #shoutmyabortion</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 12:19pm PDT</div><div class="comment">http://aboveaverage.com/the-horror-jimmy-fallon-shares-most-ridiculous-myroommateisweird-stories/#.qom09j:fFgk</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 12:07am PDT</div><div class="comment">Caliban Darklock &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, September 21, 2015 at 5:27pm PDT</div><div class="comment">My first thought when I find out I&#039;m pregnant is &quot;I hate this thing and want it out of me immediately.&quot;

yeah - seemed weird the other day - 
Ashly Lorenzana
you need to stop abusing the hyphen in everyday chatting
lol
Rick Reed
I speak in fragments
Ashly Lorenzana
it&#039;s totally not correct usage of punctuation and only makes your responses more confusing
Rick Reed
the hyphen separates them - most of the time
Ashly Lorenzana
Those weren&#039;t fragments....that was just one single thought and sentence.
I have no clue why you feel the need to insert a hyphen in the middle and DEFINITELY don&#039;t get the one at the end.
Rick Reed
I like hyphens 
Ashly Lorenzana
You wouldn&#039;t if I used them as often and as incorrectly as you do.
It would be annoying as hell.
Rick Reed
and I do use them to separate fragments for my own future understanding as well
Ashly Lorenzana
so how was that last sentence in any way fragmented?
Rick Reed
you just woke up - and I was the first excuse you could find to be annoyed
Ashly Lorenzana
SEE, that&#039;s another wrong usage of them
wtf
do you not know that commas exist
lol
Rick Reed
yes - I like comma&#039;s too
Ashly Lorenzana
Um, the locked door was the first thing that pissed me off.
So use them
Hyphens are rarely called for.
Rick Reed
I see 
Ashly Lorenzana
or better yet
break up your messages
like I&#039;m doing right now
then I dont&#039; have to wait as long
on your answers
and they are less confusing
Rick Reed
ee cummings be damned - there is no artist expression allowed
artistic
Ashly Lorenzana
e.e cummings used periods
not hyphens
Rick Reed
and failed to capitalize anything - if I recall
Ashly Lorenzana
yep
Rick Reed
I believe that is against the rules of punctuation 
Ashly Lorenzana
none of which confuses readers....periods are clear punctuation. They signify the end of a sentence, however short or long. They are not capable of the confusion of misusing the hyphen.
You might as well be using a semicolon every place you should be using a comma.
That would be just as WTF?
Rick Reed
- you know I just saw that thing that says nothing heeds to be spelled right to be comprehended the other day -
alot of the understanding lies with the reader too
Ashly Lorenzana
No, that&#039;s not totally the fact you&#039;re referencing. All correct letters from a word must be present, with the first and last letters remaining in the correct place in order for that to work.
Rick Reed
and while my fragments may modify what I just said - they are often stand alone comments as well
Ashly Lorenzana
yeah and people who understand English and how to use a hyphen will mostly be baffled by why you use them in place of commas.
THAT IS A COMMA
NOT A HYPHEN
&quot;And while my fragments may modify what I just said, they are often stand alone comments as well.&quot;
Nothing was modified there.
You were just adding more information.
That is accomplished with a COMMA.
Rick Reed
yeah, well I got tired of being corrected for using too many commas in a single sentence to 
too
Ashly Lorenzana
How often do you encounter dashes/hyphens when reading ANYTHING?
you used one right there
Rick Reed
fairly often
Ashly Lorenzana
generally speaking, commas go wherever you pause in a sentence
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/Punctuation/PunctFigs.htm
not that often
lol
nice try though
in fact, hyphen comes in LAST on that chart
lol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_of_English#Frequency
Rick Reed
yeah - but they still seem pretty common
Ashly Lorenzana
last place according to Wikipedia too
No, they don&#039;t. That&#039;s my point. You&#039;re wrong.
unless you read a lot of your own writing
lol
Rick Reed
300 per 100 words seem pretty common to me
1000 words
Ashly Lorenzana
they are the LEAST frequently used punctuation
Rick Reed
so - I like them more than most people - lol
Ashly Lorenzana
No, you have a poorer understanding of how to use them correctly than most.
Rick Reed
would you prefer / that I used slashes instead? - I like them too
Ashly Lorenzana
No, apparently I&#039;d like you to take an English class at about the 7th grade level.
A slash is used to indicate either or
two different options
And why would you put a slash between PREFER AND THAT&gt;
THAT SENTE
Rick Reed
so an url is an either/or ? I doubt it
Ashly Lorenzana
NCE WAS FINE
A URL IS NOT AN ENGLISH SENTENCE
WTF
But since you asked
THE SLASH IN A URL REPRESENTS A FOLDER DIRECTORY
ON A SPECIFIC SERVER
AS IN http://www.reed-usa.com/wp
is our WORDPRESS FOLDER/DIRECTORY
SEE THATS A PROPER USE OF A SLASH IN ENGLISH
since the word folder and directory mean the same thing, the slash is correct
and http:// slashes specify the protocol
which is hypertext transfer protocol
it&#039;s just like the slashes in your hard drive folders
they use slashes that go the other direction which means the paths are local
\\
C:\\Documents/blahblah/blah
Punctuation has it&#039;s own completely different set of rules within the context of computer programming and EACH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE has it&#039;s own syntax which means it could mean 1,000 different things depending on which you are using.
And actually
you&#039;re not even using dashes when you appear to mean to
you&#039;re using hyphens
Which are EVEN LESS CORRECT
The hyphen (‐) is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. The use of hyphens is called hyphenation.[1] The hyphen should not be confused with dashes (‒, –, —, ―), which are longer and have different uses, or with the minus sign (−), which is also longer.
you might as well be adding &#123;these&#125; things around &#123;random words&#125; throughout your sentences
that would get old real quick
Rick Reed
Because I consider  &quot;would you prefer / that I used slashes instead&quot; to have two parts - 
what is NCE?
Ashly Lorenzana
A SLASH DOES NOT SEPARATE TWO PARTS OF THE SAME SENTENCE
A COMMA DOES THAT
Did you skip middle school English or something?
THERE IS NO NEED FOR EVEN A COMMA IN THAT SENTENCE
&quot;Would you prefer i use slashes instead?&quot;
DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PUNCTUATION
Rick Reed
As a matter of fact I did skip middle school english
Ashly Lorenzana
Would you prefer I + make + no fucking + sense?
Rick Reed
I can read that just fine
Ashly Lorenzana
Well it shows. No wonder you are trying to use any fucking key on the keyboard instead of the one that makes sense.
Rick Reed
lol
Ashly Lorenzana
You can read it + but it &#123;&#125;doesn&#039;t mak&#039;e any f
*ucking sense!
Rick Reed
fucking sense - yes 
 I know you and I know what you mean
Ashly Lorenzana
Did I complain that I couldn&#039;t comprehend the words you used?
&quot;I know that, and I know what you mean.&quot;
Rule of thumb: commas go before the words &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but&quot; in most sentences.
As that indicates a pause.
Rick Reed
 well you are claiming confusion regarding my punctuation 
Ashly Lorenzana
BECAUSE TO SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS BASIC ENGLISH IT MAKES NO SENSE
Rick Reed
familiar with that rule
Ashly Lorenzana
Probably because I&#039;m the only person you text with.
WEll so use it
Rick Reed
maybe I am speaking in shorthand 
Ashly Lorenzana
But you&#039;re not
you&#039;re making your sentences make no fucking sense by randomly inserting the wrong punctuation in the wrong fucking places
where you are tempted to insert an unnecessary hyphen, just hit enter and send the message in smaller chunks
you know
like this
= less waiting time for me
Rick Reed
kind of - I may never type complete sentences with capitals at the beginning, and periods at the end. That one was for your sake.
Ashly Lorenzana
= less annoying waiting 30 mins for one sentence that makes less sense
AM I complaining about that?
That DOES NOT affect the meaning of what you say via instant messaging/chatting
Stupid use of - hyphens - does
Rick Reed
sorry - seems as if you are? Some other meaning you wish to convey?
Ashly Lorenzana
YOu are the first one mentioning periods and capitals
so no, I said nothing about those
why are you confused about that?
Rick Reed
told you I like hyphens - I like the look of them
Ashly Lorenzana
Well they make you sound dumb.
Or senile or something.
Do you have - Alzheimer&#039;s - disease? wtf?
Told you I like hyphens
I like the look of them
Rick Reed
well - I&#039;m too damn old - guess sounding dumb gives you more reason to discount me as a human being 
Ashly Lorenzana
see if you broke up into shorter messages
you&#039;d keep up better
Rick Reed
no - I took a phone call too
Ashly Lorenzana
No, your refusal to learn anything new or do anything the correct way makes me discount you as a person with any goddamn reason.
No, you took a phone call and a comma works fine for that.
Rick Reed
appreciate that 
Ashly Lorenzana
You have just as much double standards as you try to accuse me of, which is odd and funny that you try to deny.
Rick Reed
nice to know that tolerance for your idiosyncrasies, is returned 
Ashly Lorenzana
tHAT DID NOT NEED A COMMA
or anything at all
you don&#039;t pause there
AT ALL
Rick Reed
yes it did - I inteded the emphasis
Ashly Lorenzana
This is not an idiosyncrasy
It&#039;s stubbornness and incorrect for no good reason
what were you emphasizing?
commas do not add emphasis
Rick Reed
emphasis for the &quot;nice to know....is returned&quot;  - facetiousness   
Ashly Lorenzana
all CAPS adds EMPHASIS if you must....so does an EXCLAMATION POINT!
Not a comma
it does not accomplish emphasis
Rick Reed
oh - no wonder I am so incapable of expressing myself
Ashly Lorenzana
Which leads me to the oft encountered predicament of how to add emphasis to the word &quot;I&quot; since it is already capitalized and gmail doesn&#039;t support the &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em
Yeah, no shit.
&lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt;
Rick Reed
???
Ashly Lorenzana
EM
EMPHASIS
WHICH WILL ITALICIZE
Which is how emphasis is typically expressed typographically speaking
Rick Reed
is the slash a typo?
looks wrong
Ashly Lorenzana
No, it&#039;s not.
It signifies the end of the EMPHASIS TAG
&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;
Italicizes the letter I
Rick Reed
Ok - I learned something new today
Ashly Lorenzana
well unless you plan on using markup language anytime soon, it will be of little use to you
Rick Reed
so what are you doing other than brow beating me over punctuation?
Ashly Lorenzana
Ok, I learned something new today
Rick Reed
didn&#039;t mean I was going to change 
Ashly Lorenzana
It&#039;s called educating and what are you doing other than being confusing for no good reason?
Well if you can sound dumb, I have every bit as much a right to point it out every time you do it.
We&#039;ll see how irritating that is
Rick Reed
doing it the way I damn well please - who says the world gets to make the rules
Ashly Lorenzana
Doing it the way I damn well please
Who says the world gets to make the rules
Who says I can&#039;t correct you every time you do it?
Rick Reed
what makes punctuation so special that you want to follow those?
Ashly Lorenzana
You want to be stubborn, gotta be willing to put up with mine.
Rick Reed
you be annoyed if I did that to you
Ashly Lorenzana
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR COMMUNICATION MORE CLEAR AND YOU MAKE MORE SENSE
You CANNOT do it for me because you clearly don&#039;t know the correct way and I use it already.
Rick Reed
I seldom feel like you misunderstand me
Ashly Lorenzana
I usually don&#039;t say anything about how little sense your - constant- hyphen abuse- makes but why do you think conversations between us are so often fucking laborious?
I have pointed that out on multiple occasions
my bewilderment at how fucking difficult they are for no reason
that&#039;s one of the big reasons
Rick Reed
I am talking about the rest of the rules the world makes up - all made by the same fallible group called humanity
I see - what do we need to clarify?
Ashly Lorenzana
If you don&#039;t like me correcting you, I can just start ignoring sentences that make less sense due to you insisting on misusing hyphens
that works too
I like that idea better
less work for me
Rick Reed
I think it takes an ability to put yourself in the other person&#039;s position to understand their opinion - not correct hyphen usage
Ashly Lorenzana
that made absolutely no fucking sense
I don&#039;t even know what you are talking about
Rick Reed
made my point
Ashly Lorenzana
I think it takes one grade in public school and a basic understanding of English.
So if you don&#039;t care about rules
spell words however you want
see how many people understand you then
Rick Reed
do you think you usually misunderstand me?
Ashly Lorenzana
Hmmmmm
Go back and read the last hour of communication with me and answer that yourself
Rick Reed
not sure what started this - but most of the banter - back and forth - seems understood - just a different of opinion because I am using hyphens
you seem to have understood everything I said
Ashly Lorenzana
just - add- them - between - every - word- you - type -
- why - not - add- one - at the beginning - of - each - sentence - too -
since - you - add - them - at - the - end -
Rick Reed
I seldom do that - most of the fragments will stand alone as a thought
Ashly Lorenzana
You Don&#039;t - understand - the meaning - of - the word - fragment
In the context of English, fragment is used to describe a short SENTENCE.
WHICH HAS A PERIOD
BECAUSE ITS A SENTENCE
Rick Reed
   yeah - seemed weird the other day - 
that was my comment just before you started about the hyphens
Ashly Lorenzana
- - -- - - - - - - 4
THATS A FRAGMENTED THOUGHT
HOW MUCH SENSE DOES IT MAKE?
Rick Reed
did it not convey agreement with the statement you made previous and a comment about the malfunction of the board a couple of days ago?
Ashly Lorenzana
HEY GOOD JOB
THAT WAS A SENTENCE
THAT HAD NO HYPHENS
I HAVEN&#039;T EVEN READ IT YET
BUT I LIKE IT
YAY
SEE
IT CAN BE DONE -
Rick Reed
helps if you read what I write - doubtful you will get any understanding via osmosis 
Ashly Lorenzana
I read it, it has nothing to do with what we are talking about
but more importantly, THERE ARE NO STUPID AND CONFUSING HYPHENS
Rick Reed
a lot of times when you misunderstand - you overlooked something that I sent
Ashly Lorenzana
LOL
RIIIIGHT
No, ITS BECUASE - YOU DO - THAT -
Hey something -yes I do- something else that - makes little sense -
Rick Reed
I have no problem reading that - those the fragments will not stand alone 
Ashly Lorenzana
READING IS NOT SOMETHING I STRUGGLE WITH
Rick Reed
it&#039;s just words with - between them
Ashly Lorenzana
thats like. a setence. ended in. the wrong place.
And 123 this 123 is just 123 words with 123 between 123 them
Rick Reed
and I fully understand that
no problem with your intended meaning
Ashly Lorenzana
cool 123 do 123 you 123 want 123 to 123 read 123 every 123 thing 123 like 123 th 123 at?
Rick Reed
- now you are dividing words too
Ashly Lorenzana
SO WHAT WHO CARES ABOUT THE RULES
I LIKE BEING STUPID
Rick Reed
apparently you do 
Ashly Lorenzana
I 123 LIKE 123 BEING 123 STUPID
Well I guess that makes two of us
Rick Reed
though I find that surprising
Ashly Lorenzana
BECAUSE ITS NOT TRUE AND I DONT TYPE THAT WAY
DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH - HHHHHHHHHHHHHHh - HHHHHHHHHH
Rick Reed
guess you just want to pick and choose the ones you want to abide by
Ashly Lorenzana
how about i just | separate | word|with|one|of|these|instead|of|using|spaces
Rick Reed
I have never seen those words before either - want to direct me to the dictionary where you found them
Ashly Lorenzana
orjustsayfuckspacesaltogetherihatethespacebar
Rick Reed

CO-OPERATION

NO HYPHEN
Use a comma every time you go to use a hyphen and you&#039;ll be in good shape
Rick Reed
i understand ridicule creating a greater state of being obstinate - I have a hard time understanding why a polite request isn&#039;t met with more co-operation 
Ashly Lorenzana
or break the messages up

you even have options
I WAS THE ONE MAKING THE REQUEST BY POINTING OUT THE ERROR AND EXPLAINING WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD TO MAKE MORE SENSE
you are the one being stupid about it

jeez - maybe- its -because - you - dont know how to -type or write a sentence

Rick Reed
what are you doing - you have been on my ass about typing and now punctuation - you just need to put distance between us this week  
that was a question
Ashly Lorenzana
what was?
Rick Reed
you need a &quot;?&quot; to know that?
Ashly Lorenzana
No, an asterisk would also communicate that somethiing is a question I&#039;m sure you agree*
Rick Reed
actually their were two, separated by - and -
Ashly Lorenzana
Yeah and as usual, you are making fucking zero sense
I have no clue what was asked
if anything
Rick Reed
why are you sure I agree - I could easily disagree - simply to be disagreeable - or for the simple goal of continuing the agrument

I took debate in school - I can argue either side - makes no matter - generally you get the benefit of what I truly believe - rather than simple comment for the sake of winning
Ashly Lorenzana
This isn&#039;t debate material. The answers are easily googled and I&#039;m correct and you&#039;re not.
This is English class, not debate team.
Your &quot;perspective&quot; on this means dick.
You&#039;re wrong.
Rick Reed
made my point again
Ashly Lorenzana
My point is you are INCORRECT. Refusing to admit it is&#039;t making you look smarter or like more of a &quot;rebel.&quot;
Okay so if I give you 8 x 8 what do you get?
Rick Reed
the request is a power struggle - not an attempt to understand my comments better
64 
Ashly Lorenzana
because you are refusing to make them more easily understandable out of stubbornness
NOPE WRONG
I MEANT EIGHT DIVIDED BY EIGHT BUT I LIKE THE MULTIPLICATION SIGN BETTER THAN THE DIVISION SIGN
YOu SHOULD JUST GET USED TO THAT
Rick Reed
a piece of wood 8&quot; thick by 8&quot; wide
Ashly Lorenzana
I don&#039;t like the rules. The division sign is ugly. I like the multiply sign better so I use that when I mean to say divide a number.
Get used to it
Rick Reed
or a scaffold bay 8&#039;wide X 8&#039; deep 
Ashly Lorenzana
NOPE
I use x for division
because I like it better
thought you liked breaking rules
you should get it
you should know every time I say what is 7 x 5 I mean what is 7 divided by 5
Rick Reed
obviously understanding words requires some context - and an ability to follow along  
Ashly Lorenzana
it works just as well
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUNCTUATION
THOSE ARE SYMBOLS
NOT FUCKIGN WORDS
Rick Reed
35 in that case 
Ashly Lorenzana
WRO
NG
tHat is not 7 divided by 5
Rick Reed
I get it
Ashly Lorenzana
Does it sound fucking stupid?
Because it is
Also, when I use - I actually mean addition
not subtraction
I don&#039;t like that rule either
Rick Reed
most things taken to extremes turn ridiculous 
Ashly Lorenzana
I&#039;m doiNG THE EXACT THIG YOU ARE
CHANGING THE FUNCTION OF A SYMBOL THAT MEANS SOMETHING
JUST BECAUSE
AND IT MAKES IT WRONG
YOu ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME FUCKING THING
Rick Reed
you breaks lots of rules
Ashly Lorenzana
You wear black a lot
Rick Reed
your reasons for doing so are no better than mine
Ashly Lorenzana
SO minus becomes plus divide becomes multiply
and it&#039;s WRONG
I don&#039;t break rules that are FACTS.
Because that&#039;s dumb
and confuses people
unless you want to start using the wrong mathematical symbol for what you are trying to do, you can&#039;t make any argument for changing the meaning of a punctuation symbol arbitrarily
Rick Reed
there are no facts to language - it is simply collective agreement and an attempt to clarify communication - mathematics is much closer to fact and law than any word or symbol
Ashly Lorenzana
LOL
Rick Reed
words are merely an agreement about the opinion they have expressed in the past
Ashly Lorenzana
THEN WHY DOES EACH PIECE OF PUNCTUATION HAVE A DICTIONARY DEFINITION JUST LIKE EVERY MATH SYMBOL?
WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING WORDS
YOU DON&#039;T USE WORDS THAT I DON&#039;T UNDERSTAND TRUST ME
THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE
THE MEANING OF SYMBOLS, MATHEMATICAL OR GRAMMATICAL, IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH FACT AS THE OTHER

Now imagine this: a woman is offered having all of her wants and needs taken care of for her and a position of power over virtually every man she comes into contact with. She turns it down because she doesn&#039;t really want to be seen as a whore and has little interest in having lots of sex and getting whatever she wants as a result.

I happened to be sitting outside on the front porch when he delivered both of these packages. 

The first time, I had been working on the cam site at some point the night before and had several of my, erm, work &quot;props&quot; left out sitting on the table. Conveniently, a giant butt plug was hiding right behind my laptop screen, blocking my view of it entirely while at the same time exposing it along with my not-so-secret dirtiness rather prominently to the cute young man approaching me with package in hand.

I smile at him because &#039;How YOU Doin&#039;?&#039; and say &quot;Thanks!&quot;

He smiles too, seems a little shy and uncertain, waves and says hello and leaves.

Hours later, I notice the dope pipe and sex toys all over my table and realize what a circus freak he probably thinks I am. And how true that probably is.

The next time he came by to deliver a package, Bub was tethered on the deck with me. Bub has always lived his life on his own terms and only his own. He has fearlessly devoted most of it to barking at either something, every thing or nothing.

So he&#039;s going insane as the guy approaches. Most mail delivery people and package deliverers act like pussies around dogs, even one the size of Bub (don&#039;t tell him I implied he wasn&#039;t huge and terrifying, he&#039;ll never speak to me again). 

But this guy just approached him slowly, hand outstretched to allow Bub&#039;s nose to smell and subsequently make an initial judgement of him.

OMG, sexy factor just quadrupled!

There is nothing sexier than a man who knows how to respectfully meet and interact with the species of animal who happens to be both the most loyal and amazing, while also boasting poorest judgement on choosing cross species best friends.

Again, I thanked him as he set the package down and while we couldn&#039;t hear each other very well over Bub&#039;s incessant barking, he asked me what kind of dog he is. 

&quot;Half Chihuahua and half Rat Terrier.&quot;

&quot;He&#039;s got some muscles there!&quot;

Needless to say, Bub likes the dude already.

For someone I have really only objectified and who less than a paragraph worth of sentences has been exchanged with me, so do I. ;-)

So...my idea for scoring pimp points and breaking the ice is to QUICKLY order something else from Amazon and then when he gets here to deliver it, I will hand it back to him and just say, &quot;I got this for you, actually. Here&#039;s my number so you can tell me what you think of it later after you open it.&quot;

:) :) :)

Okay, so my question is: what is an inexpensive and cool idea for a gift for this guy from Amazon that will pretty much guarantee that he puts out on the first &quot;date?&quot;

Ideas, anyone?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, July 18, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT</div><div class="comment">http://likefake.com/

Years ago when doing research for the healthiest brand of dog food to buy for Bub, I discovered this gem of a site that helped me better understand labels on dog food products and made it easier for me to identify harmful ingredients. 

I was appalled by the brand I had been feeding him at that time because it had a lot of the bad shit in it, so I threw it all out and never bought another bag of it again.

Do not put multiple fucking mute buttons on an ad when none of them fucking work, are you really that big of an asshole?

I guess they probably offer advertisers three tiers and the one you pay most for is the one where the mute buttons are a fucking decoration or a joke or whatever cute term they have for it.

LOL. Trust me, buddy...as far as films go, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is not particularly difficult to understand. 

Perhaps the difficult part is giving a shit or thinking it&#039;s worth watching. To call the guys in this film &quot;heroes&quot; is the funniest part of this whole thing.

People saving lives, fighting for change, starting revolutions, standing up for what they believe in and getting real shit done are heroes, not the self-serving jackasses portrayed in a movie like this one.

No offense to fans of the film, I just think it should be called what it is and find it as ridiculous as calling the Sex in the City women fucking &quot;heroes.&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 11, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played Wordox.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 11, 2015 at 4:18pm PDT</div><div class="comment">I think that once a person has gone through puberty, weight should remain as static as height.

So I go outside and don&#039;t see him and started getting worried because I thought he&#039;d be waiting, LOL.

I walked around to the front of the building and saw this guy sitting on the steps smoking a cigarette. I asked him if he knew where a pay phone was around there, but kind of laughed as I asked since I knew it was a dumb question....

He&#039;s like &quot;what year did you just come from? there are no pay phones anymore.&quot; 

I&#039;m like, &quot;yeah, pretty much.&quot;

So he let me use his phone, but Rick didn&#039;t answer so we just sat there talking and eventually he informed me it was 10:22 and I&#039;m like oh well no wonder he&#039;s not here yet, LOL

I could smell booze on him and he was obviously a little drunk.

He told me he just got here from Boston for his son&#039;s graduation from Portland State or whatever....lol. I&#039;m like right on, we chatted for about another 20 mins....

I offered him a cookie since I had some leftover from the meeting that I&#039;d brought and as I have my mouth full of cracker and cheese, he asks &quot;what do you want most in life?&quot;

I frowned and tried to hurry up chewing, covering my mouth and putting a finger up to put him on hold.

Then I finally said &quot;I want my dog to live forever.&quot;

He looks confused for a second and then smiles. I stand up and pull my pants down a little and my shirt up a bit to reveal Bub&#039;s face and just say &quot;he&#039;s my baby.&quot;

He laughs and smiles and talks about some chick&#039;s dog that licked him all over the face earlier when he was waiting for the MAX.

&quot;I love your voice. You have an enthusiasm for life that I don&#039;t often sense in people in Boston, which is really nice. You&#039;ve made my night glorious, thank you.&quot;

First, I tried to inject in my leg. I probably shouldn&#039;t have. That vein is pretty much on its way out...after a few pokes I stopped and gave up on it.

Couple hours later, there is this tightness running along that vein on my inner thigh and it hurts like a motherfucker. Every step was painful, even coughing while just sitting hurt it...

Then the pain showed up in my lower back. Very intense dull, achy pain that was REALLY bad. I took a handful of aspirin. 

Thought sleeping might help and was hoping I&#039;d wake up feeling better. Instead, my arm now hurts EVEN worse than I think my leg or back did yesterday. It feels like a very severe muscle pain, but I don&#039;t really have to move it at all or do anything to make the pain noticeable.

It&#039;s getting so bad that I almost can&#039;t ignore it...I did nothing at all to it yesterday that would explain why it hurts like this. I literally feel like someone just kicked me as hard as they could several times in several places. 

Might have to break down and give in and go to ER later if it doesn&#039;t get better soon...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, May 27, 2015 at 11:22am PDT</div><div class="comment">Coolio I am sending you a video hello shortly:)  nice to reconnect Ashly Lorenzana</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 26, 2015 at 7:00am PDT</div><div class="comment">Some people swear that birds used to be dinosaurs.

Being the dip shit I&#039;m sometimes known for being, I managed to get off two stops too soon. Fuck!

I&#039;m standing there waiting for the next train to arrive and take me two more stops when this rather attractive, young South American man walks up to me and begins to strike up a conversation with me. 

&quot;What&#039;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Ashly. And yours?&quot;

&quot;Christian.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;

We shake hands.

&quot;How old are you?&quot;

&quot;27. And you?&quot;

&quot;18.&quot;

&quot;Are you single?&quot;

&quot;Eh...sort of?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, sort of?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#039;m in an open relationship.&quot;

&quot;What does that mean?&quot;

&quot;Like, we see other people too.&quot;

&quot;That&#039;s weird.&quot;

&quot;It&#039;s a little different, yes.&quot;

&quot;And you&#039;re okay with this?&quot;

&quot;Of course. In fact, it&#039;s the only way I can be in any relationship at all. Otherwise I just end up getting in trouble, you know what I mean?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...so if I were to ask you for a kiss right now, what would you say?&quot;

&quot;What?! Um..uh....I don&#039;t know.&quot;

&quot;C&#039;mon...&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you&#039;re 18?&quot;

&quot;I&#039;m 19 actually.&quot;

&quot;Oh, fuck it...what the hell?&quot;

We then proceed to make out while standing there. After returning his tongue, he asks me to write my phone number on his arm with a black sharpie pen, so I do.

&quot;Well, shit...too bad there are no dark places around here...&quot;

&quot;Oh, there are, c&#039;mon let&#039;s go.&quot;

&quot;I can&#039;t miss my MAX!&quot;

&quot;When does it arrive?&quot;

&quot;9 minutes.&quot;

&quot;That&#039;s enough time.&quot;

When I returned to the platform, I had four minutes to spare. 

We&#039;ll see if he calls.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at 10:41pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana and Jesse Panama are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at 10:19pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Yay, Ashly is back!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 12, 2015 at 12:55am PDT</div><div class="comment">Hey, look who&#039;s back!

But after reading this story, I&#039;m struggling to figure out how I actually feel about this entire concept...

I pride myself on being an open-minded person who thinks well outside of the box, but something about this reeks of something that is just not right...

Personally, I do NOT like the fact that this young woman lost her virginity to her own father. Like...if she had been an older adult with more experiences of her own already, I would be much more comfortable with this story. 

Seriously, I could almost be okay with it if that had been the case. 

For whatever reason, I feel like someone who has had a couple of their own romantic relationships and lived a little life already is kind of totally within their rights to decide to hook up with their biological father who they never knew, if they so choose to.

I would never do it personally, but I don&#039;t really judge anyone who chooses to do that under those circumstances.

The part that alarms me most about this though is that she plans to have children with her own father and claims to have &quot;done her own research&quot; on the risks involved and doesn&#039;t seem worried about them.

Her argument that incest has been around throughout human history is not one which you can use as support of, well, anything. Rape and war have been around as long as we have too, but that hardly means we should just let both run rampant and just accept them.

They should be treated as serious issues, along with the potential risk of bringing someone into the world with significant genetic problems as the result of inbreeding.

The only thing I take comfort in here is that she AT LEAST has enough sense to know that she should NOT tell their kids that their dad is her dad too. Ugh. 

I actually wish these two people the best of luck though, in all honesty and sincerity. I really hope that nothing is grossly wrong here, even if it feels like something is off to me as an outsider.

If we ask a woman who was raped how many sexual partners she&#039;s had in her life, should she count her rapist among those? NO. Why? Because the word &quot;partner&quot; implies consent between two people.

Did she have sex with her rapist? Yes.

But for her to include him in her response, the question would instead need to be, &quot;How many people have had penetrative sex with you?&quot;

This distinction gets more than a little uncomfortable, but it is an IMPORTANT one to make.

Stop trying to say that victims of human trafficking are sex workers. They are NOT. They are victims of a crime and that crime is most certainly NOT prostitution. Wake the fuck up.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, February 8, 2015 at 1:10am PST</div><div class="comment">A college degree can&#039;t be earned if it has to be bought, which it does.

NEVER choose your husband or wife over your children. You brought them into this world and they should be the most important thing in the world to you --- more important than yourself and certainly more important than any ultimatum thrown at you.

Anyone who plans to carry a pregnancy to full term and have a child is required by law to file an application of viability. It&#039;s just an application that assesses the viability of your means to support another human&#039;s life.

You would NOT need the government&#039;s stamp of approval to have kids. It would not be illegal to have one if your application wasn&#039;t approved. None of that would change.

But what it would mean is that there is actual proof on file that you are not in a situation where you have enough to meet a child&#039;s basic needs and have acknowledged that fact. It doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have the child and you would be doing nothing wrong by choosing to do so.

What it would mean is that you are not eligible for government assistance. It would mean YOU are the person who will be held responsible to ensure that child&#039;s needs are met to the standards of the laws already existing, just like any other parent. 

This would also NOT mean you have to make a certain amount of money to support a child. 

For example, if you have family who is willing to help with caring for the child then you could have them sign and explain their relationship to the person applying in place of the money that would be otherwise required to cover day care costs.

The principle seems like it would work to me because it is placing the blame for children not having what they need on the person who chooses to bring the into the world under poor circumstances rather than the government. 

We don&#039;t hold the government responsible for our kids beyond the laws already in place. As in, they are required to attend school and cannot be neglected or abused within the current legal definitions of those terms.

In cases of abuse, the government can step in and have the child removed from the household. This would still be true. And it would be what happens when it is determined that the child isn&#039;t getting the basic care they need.

The parent would not receive ANYTHING. They would lose their child if it was determined they were not caring for it to the standard of the law, same as now. They would not be eligible for welfare.

On the other hand, those who had proven viability for their child would be eligible to receive welfare benefits because they have proven on paper beforehand that they are responsible and everyone who ISN&#039;T lazy or abusing the system legitimately needs help sometimes. We all face situations in the future where help is legit. 

This is no different than applying for a permit to build something because it is the legal and responsible way to build something without running into problems. 

You still have the choice to build something without the permission, but there are consequences to breaking laws and you will not have the same protection that a legally operating builder would have as a result of following the law.

She killed herself because her parents thought and felt that her being transgendered made her so bad that she was worth hating, and she therefore grew to hate herself as she described in her suicide note. 

Her advice to parents is wise but not specific to transgendered people. Or homosexual people. Or people who don&#039;t believe in the same religion they were raised to believe. Or people who become prostitutes and are put down and disapproved of by their parents for that reason. 

It doesn&#039;t matter why your own family decides you are not worth loving, but when they do that then the results are catastrophic. Really the difference between ending your own life in that situation or choosing to trudge along comes down to how well you can cope with a level of adversity that most people never experience, not only from the outside world but from those who are supposed to be closest to you.

I know exactly what she felt like when her parents reacted how they did to a major part of who she was. It&#039;s incredibly sad to be in that position and to be as powerless to change how your own flesh and blood feels about you as you are to change what they hate about you.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 29, 2014 at 10:43pm PST</div><div class="comment">While I have never personally understood finding any sense of belonging or comfort in a gathering such as an NA or AA meeting, I do get the concept of &quot;sharing&quot; the same struggle as another person and the inherent intimacy of that two-way realization or whatever. 

But seriously, why would you ever need to validate your problems in such a setting? 

Whenever I feel weird or creepy for the things I think or wonder how far gone I must actually be, I just start typing the darkest shit in my brain into the Google search box and within a word or two I have all the confirmation I need that there is a large number of kindred creeps out there who would be sending me postcards from the next tier of hopelessness.

Rooting for her in the election.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, October 8, 2014 at 7:28pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Miniclip.com.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, October 8, 2014 at 7:24pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Miniclip.com.</p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, October 5, 2014 at 9:05pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Miniclip.com.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, October 3, 2014 at 8:09am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, October 3, 2014 at 4:39am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana added a new photo — with Marcus Brit Cleman.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 8:56pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Hope you&#039;re having a fantastic day Ashly!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 4:33pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy birthday!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 1:54pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy birthday!!!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 1:18pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy birthday!!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 1:03pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday </div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 2, 2014 at 12:44pm PDT</div><div class="comment">You&#039;re 27?

I ordered a pizza at 12:11PM and was told it would be delivered in an 1 hour and 18 minutes. It is now 1:47 and I called to ask what the fuck the problem was. A very monotonous voice on the other end of the line informed me that he was at an hour and a half for deliveries. I told him the website had said it would be an hour and eighteen minutes, and he said he incorrectly quoted me on the time. He said he has one driver and 20 orders and that they will shut him down if his delivery times are any longer. WTF? Get your shit together Pizza Hut. If you&#039;re going to be open on a holiday, be prepared. Otherwise just shut your doors until Tuesday.

garbage should be disposed of immediately. 

However, I&#039;d like to make a point that the mention of him smoking meth is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to this entire story. It is mentioned here for NO GOOD REASON and all it does is make people jump on the &quot;meth haters&quot; bandwagon, which it obviously succeeds at judging by some of these ignorant comments.

I am 100% in favor of torturing this waste of life until his last breath. 

But I am 100% against using this as some reason to direct hatred towards a group of people as diverse as drug users. As someone who has used meth regularly for almost a decade, I can assure you I know plenty of people who use meth and WOULD NEVER in their wildest dreams even CONTEMPLATE doing something on this level of disgusting and hideous. 

I know meth addicts who are loving fathers who pay their child support every month, as hard as that may be for the people here to believe. It&#039;s a fact. Doing drugs is not what drives a person to commit crimes as vile as these. These people are SICK in the head. 

The fact that they may or may not also be drug addicts has NOTHING to do with actions like this...let&#039;s stop grouping together all drug addicts and pointing the finger at substance abuse. It&#039;s ignorant and is the reason why addicts are treated like shit, even when they are not bad people. No one is bad for choosing to use drugs. They are bad when they do shit like this.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 16, 2014 at 10:39am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 16,

And more likely to lose our minds
Perhaps this is so
Only because
The longer we are here
The less the details matter
Increasing the blurriness of 
Events, places, names
That were once upon a time
Attached to certain memories
They all begin to melt into each other
As we move closer to death
At some point 
We reach an age
Where it&#039;s hard to keep caring
About the seemingly silly
Little details

A #Google doodle that features a woman worth celebrating!

I don&#039;t know about anyone else, but I have been mostly disappointed with versions of the Google logo which featured women in the past. I&#039;m sure I missed a couple good ones, but I have mostly thought that the females chosen didn&#039;t accomplish anything noteworthy enough to be featured.

The first involves securing rights for those in the sex trade, establishing the difference between those who willfully choose sex work and those who are victims of human trafficking and promoting acceptance towards sex workers in the United States. The second is challenging the war on drugs, offering transparency on the topic of drug addiction and refusing to blindly accept the bull shit we are fed about the dangers of these drugs. Now I know what my missions are, I just have to figure out how to get started.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 5:33pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 4:26pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 4:19pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:56pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:45pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:42pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:39pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:37pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:33pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3:26pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Sporcle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 1:01pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 12:55pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 12:51pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 6:20am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 12, 2014 at 6:20am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana won a battle on Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, May 10, 2014 at 4:06pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, May 10, 2014 at 4:02pm PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Word Battle.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, May 10, 2014 at 3:47pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy Fuck My Mothers Day.

fucking disappear without a trace?! W.T.F. I don&#039;t get it...no distress signal, should have had enough fuel to make it&#039;s 6+ hour flight as scheduled...what the hell happened, exactly? What are the theories? Could it have been hijacked, hence the lack of distress signal? Something happened to the pilots? Why did it take so long for the rescue mission to get out to the spot in the ocean where it was last known to be? If it crashed into the water, what would likely have happened? would it have sunk completely and trapped everyone inside? Would anything be floating or no? I&#039;m so confused.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 10:12pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 10:12pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 10:02pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 10:02pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:46pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:45pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:41pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:41pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:39pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:39pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:38pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:38pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:33pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:33pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:31pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 9:30pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana collected a stack of tokens on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 6:00am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 6:00am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:48am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:32am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:31am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:19am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:19am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:17am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:17am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:14am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:14am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:09am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 5:09am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:51am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:51am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:42am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:42am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:40am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:40am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:27am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 7, 2014 at 12:27am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, March 6, 2014 at 9:18pm PST</div><div class="comment">Broke 10,000 words today.

I don&#039;t know how many times or for how long I&#039;ve told myself that I could &quot;Never&quot; write a fiction book, but I&#039;m going to enjoy proving myself dead wrong.

My piece of shit cunt-faced mother is throwing a goddamn tantrum at 40 years old because my grandmother told her she wasn&#039;t invited to the 50th anniversary celebration for her and my grandfather because I am going to be there and I don&#039;t want to see the stupid bitch. Now my grandmother obviously feels bad about telling her she can&#039;t come...I just want to know WHY THE FUCK anyone would feel a SHRED of guilt over not inviting a daughter who stole jewelry from my grandmother that my grandfather had given her as gifts to buy heroin and get high? Or who kicked her own child (guess who?) out on the street because she was so paranoid from using drugs and spending too much time locked her bedroom with her paranoid schizophrenic husband that she convinced herself of all sorts of crazy and off the wall shit and then intentionally set our house on fire, causing me to lose many of my most treasured possessions forever. Who cares that when my stepfather slept with me at the age of sixteen, all she had to say was I shouldn&#039;t have been wearing what I had on and I was just trying to hurt her because I could have yelled or done something to stop it. Who gives a flying fuck that she shot me up with drugs before I was even eighteen years old? Apparently no one. And I&#039;m so sick of it. I have no idea why the fuck no one in my goddamn family calls her on the fact that she&#039;s been a disgusting fucking waste of life and she has zero right to be upset AT ALL if she&#039;s not invited to an event with the family she has proven time and time again to not give two shits about.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:53am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:53am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:41am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana moved up in a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:33am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:30am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:30am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana completed a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana favorited a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana favorited a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana favorited a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana favorited a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana favorited a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:12am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 9:11am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana collected a stack of tokens on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 11:31pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana broke a record in ThreeAngo on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 11:31pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana moved up in a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 11:17pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a game on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 11:16pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana collected a stack of tokens on Games on Mindjolt.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, March 4, 2014 at 3:34pm PST</div><div class="comment">I refuse to use hashtags in my Facebook status updates for the simple reason that they are, well, gay as all hell.

For example, why the hell does anyone who smokes weed give two shits that it happens to be illegal? I mean, unless you&#039;ve been busted for it. If you haven&#039;t, then why not just carry on and stop making such a huge fuss over it? Lots of shit is illegal and won&#039;t be legal any time soon. You don&#039;t see me posting to Facebook every goddamn day about how prostitution should be legalized, even though I think it definitely should be. Perhaps if I had been busted for it myself, I&#039;d be more vocal about it because I&#039;d have more reason to be. And it&#039;s a far more serious matter than smoking the green too, yet you don&#039;t hear everyone getting all worked up about that now do you? If you&#039;re getting away with something that&#039;s illegal, shut the fuck up and continue doing whatever it is. To you, it doesn&#039;t make any difference whether or not the government says what you are doing is okay.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, March 3, 2014 at 1:25am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana

They are known for harassing people who owe them for credit card debt. They have no shame whatsoever. They screwed me over on a purchase I made for which I never received the item I paid for and I promptly cancelled my account with them. They are a joke, seriously. People are saying the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protects people from unlawful searches and seizures, but lets not all forget how that goes right the fuck out the window anytime we board an airplane to travel within the US or abroad.

Let&#039;s hope you have your shit together and can keep it together, otherwise it quickly becomes apparent that what you thought you owned is only yours when you pay for them in the form of taxes, debts, bills and court settlements. 

Here&#039;s to being a loser and enjoying TRUE freedom. I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way, honestly.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, February 7, 2014 at 3:31am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana followed a person on Goodreads.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, February 4, 2014 at 9:41pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana commented on KD Comic Book Creation.<div class="comment">Hi there Michael, could you please email me at ashly&#064;ashlylorenzana.com and I will send you the updated version?

even realize I&#039;m doing. Obviously one of the ways that the drugs shine through...I should just start any future webinars with a quick disclaimer: If constant mouse moving drives you crazy then I&#039;m on more drugs than you can handle and it&#039;s probably safer to exit now. You&#039;ve been warned.

It sucks like every other holiday. I guess when you have no family you keep in touch with, it&#039;s just like any other day. Except for everything is closed, which is inconvenient. The only cool thing about Christmas is Bub. The day before Christmas Eve exactly 7 years ago to the date, I discovered my little son and since then he has been the ONLY light that illuminates my life as I generally stumble through it in darkness. I love you, little Bub. You are quite literally my everything. You keep my heart beating, little guy.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 23, 2013 at 2:39am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana accomplished a card combo on Pyramid Solitaire Saga.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, December 20, 2013 at 8:02pm PST</div><div class="comment">By far the saddest thing about this retard on Duck Dynasty is the fact that as many people apparently watch this kind of trash to begin with. Um, hello...if you weren&#039;t watching it and perhaps were doing, I don&#039;t know, better things with your time, the idiot would be talking to himself and he wouldn&#039;t have a show that makes it possible for him to send a message to so many people and he wouldn&#039;t have the power to upset a single fucking person, gay, straight or otherwise. Honestly, I had never even heard of this ridiculous and steaming pile of inbred feces before this happened (I have much better things to do than watch TV, thank you) and when I started seeing posts on Facebook about someone saying something insensitive, I made the silly assumption that the person who said it was of SOME IMPORTANCE. You know, like a political figure or someone in some type of leadership position that it would be upsetting to hear something like this from. And then it turns out to be THIS SHIT? WHO THE FUCK CARES? GET A LIFE AND GO LIVE IT STOP WATCHING THE DUMB FUCKING SHIT THAT IS ON TV THAT REALLY JUST INSULTS YOUR FUCKING INTELLIGENCE. IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY WHAT THIS WASTE OF LIFE SAID THEN YOU FUCKING SUCK AND I AM NOT GOING TO ADMIT I KNOW YOU. FUCK.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, December 20, 2013 at 1:12pm PST</div><div class="comment">If Voodoo dolls actually worked, my mom would be one seriously dead fucking bitch.

One of these things is swearing in a professional atmosphere. While I agree that there are specific SITUATIONS in which it would be insensitive to curse, I think that is more of a case-by-case decision to make and not something to swear off (pun intended) altogether. It&#039;s one of the reasons why I love Gary Vaynerchuk so fucking much, the man swears freely on a pretty consistent basis. I love that about him and think that more people should speak openly and throw in some profanity from time to time. Thanks for keeping it real, Gary. Stop being afraid to swear just because of who is in the room...if they can&#039;t handle it, FUCK THEM. Sorry guys, just my two cents.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 18, 2013 at 2:32pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana wants to read Prose and Lore (Issue 3) via Goodreads.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 16, 2013 at 5:56pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana likes a link.<div class="comment">Whoa, this thing was incredibly close.

If people put you down and don&#039;t believe in you and do their best to prevent you from becoming who you were meant to be, there is only one way to deal with this. If everyone around you thinks their way is right and yours is wrong and you know deep down that they are full of shit, then I only have one piece of advice for you: Learn to fucking THRIVE on all that negative shit instead of letting it drag you down. Hang on to their disapproval and use it to spit down on their faces when you are towering above them because you&#039;ve proven them wrong and done everything they said you wouldn&#039;t or couldn&#039;t do in your wildest dreams. Don&#039;t forget the things they say, because you&#039;ll want to throw the words back at them to choke on when they turn out to be 100% wrong. In the meantime, revel in all the bull shit they heap onto you in the hopes of getting under your skin. Fuck them, seriously. Get angry if you want to or if you need to. You probably should. Get fucking pissed in fact. Use that to fuel the fire within you until you kick so much ass that everyone who had something to say before is speechless. Because they will be, I promise. And fuck them.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, December 9, 2013 at 11:00am PST</div><div class="comment">I have mastered the art of being a complete and total bitch without coming across as rude or terribly offensive. But --- I still prefer going straight for the jugular with vulgarity, to be completely honest. It&#039;s just that when I do that, it brings me down with whoever I&#039;m attacking and that usually doesn&#039;t do me any favors.

I&#039;m having one a bit prematurely. I know that there is something out there waiting for me, but I don&#039;t know what it is. I need to find it though. I have to. It&#039;s the only thing that will brighten my spirits and add meaning to my life. I had better find it before I die, because if I don&#039;t then everything up until now will have been a total waste. I&#039;m not 18 anymore, I don&#039;t have forever to figure it out. I&#039;m still young, but the clock is ticking. What is it? What can I do to change the world? I&#039;m not doing anything to change it now, at least not on a grand enough scale. I want to be part of something exciting that actually helps make possible a change in the world for the better. But how...? I don&#039;t work well with others and I&#039;m eternally hopeless and gloomy rather than motivated and optimistic. I just know I have to find it.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, November 16, 2013 at 1:26am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana followed a person on Goodreads.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, November

enough to face the rest of my life alone.  I think I see a fork in the road ahead. One path is a lonely one, but one that enjoys more control over my own destiny and comes with a strong sense of empowerment. The other one comes with a huge amount of sacrifice but I won&#039;t travel it by myself. I hate making choices that eliminate other possibilities, but this one seems fucking inevitable and I&#039;m not sure what will happen.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, October 14, 2013 at 1:34pm

Why is there no thought in my head that makes all of this better...why can&#039;t I make sense of it all? It&#039;s so hard to not think of everything as pointless when I consider that we all end up in the same place regardless of how we spend our lives or what we do with the time we have...if anyone has any comforting response, feel free to share.

We spent so much time together and it&#039;s only gotten worse as time goes on! I know use my laptop as a pillow which I often nod out on, drooling all over my keyboard. It&#039;s not something I&#039;m proud of, but it&#039;s the truth. Anyway, the funny thing is that I USED to cry when I heard this because it meant I had a wait time of about 10 minutes before the Internet and I would be there in the same room together...now I cry for the sake of nostalgia. </div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, August 11, 2013 at 4:44pm PDT</div><div class="comment">http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone/

The letter ended by saying that they don&#039;t wish to embarrass me and instructed me to call them within 72 hours of receiving the letter. So I did. I called them up and told them the only ones that were going to suffer any embarrassment was them once they wasted even more money on an investigation, only to find that I am unemployed and own nothing. It was a brief conversation. I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t feel that I owe them shit. All I did was drive fast and get too many tickets until my license was suspended, and after it was suspended, the tickets turned into $1,000 every time I was stopped, even if it was for a license plate light going out on me. Can&#039;t get insurance with a suspended license, which adds more shit to each ticket I received after it was first suspended several years ago. Fuck them. As far as I am concerned, I don&#039;t owe them fucking shit. They can suck my dick though...if I&#039;m feeling generous, that is. But they might not be cool enough, on second thought.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 12:59pm PDT</div><div class="comment">https://www.slixa.com/under-cover/150-3-reasons-why-meet-n-greets-are-a-smart</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 12:19am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana followed a person on Goodreads.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, May 15, 2013 at 7:46pm PDT</div><div class="comment">https://www.slixa.com/under-cover/156-common-requests-from-clients-and-how-to</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 14, 2013 at 7:10pm PDT</div><div class="comment">http://www.monapdx.com/linkedin-says-fuck-you-to-all-escorts-and-sex-workers/</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 14, 2013 at 4:31pm PDT</div><div class="comment">LinkedIn doesn&#039;t give a fuck if prostitution or escort services are operating legally.

Although I don’t consider myself much of a fiction writer these days, I still have a deep appreciation for creative writing when done right.

It’s no secret that fiction authors are certainly getting the biggest checks from Amazon each month, that’s for sure. Everything from Fifty Shades of Grey to author success stories like J.A. Konrath and Amanda Hocking, it’s become clear that Kindle owners are on the market for entertaining fiction more than anything else. 

Obviously this also means you will have tons of competition if you choose to publish a fiction novel in Amazon’s Kindle store. But at the end of the day, I suppose, it all sort of balances out.

How to Write Better Fiction

Creative writing is, in many way, much scarier than writing non-fiction stuff or even narrative style works. Fiction writing is a craft and it can go dreadfully wrong if you don’t know what the hell you’re doing, as I’m sure you’ve discovered about half way through reading a book that you finally gave up on finishing. 

The good news is that it’s all subjective. Some people will love whatever you end up publishing, others will hate on it. As a friend of mine pointed out to me recently, it’s not about how talented you are or how great your art is. It’s about how many people think it’s worth buying. Kind of true, in a sense.

So today I wanted to compile a short list of creative writing communities from around the web that seem to offer helpful resources for improving your skills with the pen. I have tried these out and have varying levels of experience with each, so I hope to give you a snapshot of what to expect. 

Fifteen Minutes of Fiction

This is a fairly simple site that offers a great outlet for busy people to fit some fiction writing into their days. Most of us have fifteen minutes to spare, right? Ditch the reality show you are glued to and try this instead.

They provide a weekly writing prompt if you are having an inspiration drought as well. You can also read other people’s writing as well.

Scribe Slice

Another even simpler creative writing community that has everything from poetry to short stories and beyond. Super simple interface for quick posting and easy browsing. For the fiction writing minimalists out there, this one is for you.

Stories Space

I haven’t used this one too much yet, but it appears to be similar to ScribeSlice and describes itself as a place where writers can post their stories, comment on other stories and publish your own fiction. They also have a forum and chat and you must be at least sixteen years old to join.

Once Written

This is a neat site for any writer or author to check out. They apparently do book reviews which they refer to as “recommendations” since they go on to explain that they do not review books they don’t care for, nor do they guarantee that they will finish reading yours if you submit yours for review, which you can do here.

They also feature author interviews, writing contests, book giveaways, paid promotional services for authors and offer tons of free and premium resources for aspiring writers as well.

The Next Big Writer

This site requires a small monthly membership fee to post your writing and they guarantee feedback for paid members. Reading and reviewing is free, of course. 

Some interesting and potentially cool sounding benefits of being a paid user include: opportunities to compete for publishing contracts, a ranking to compare your work with other writers on the site, and a fan system.

The monthly subscription is $7.95 or you can save a couple bucks each month by opting for the yearly subscription which will set you back $49.95. I would recommend this site for the serious fiction writers out there who are really interested in getting feedback and critiques for their work. Otherwise, the investment isn’t going to be worth it in my opinion.

Write for 10

This works great for both a community and a daily writing exercise, which I’m sure we all could use. As you probably already figured out, the concept is basic and involves writing about anything under the sun (or above it) for at least ten minutes. 

This is kind of neat because you can go back and get an idea of what you were doing a week or a year ago when you put paper to pen for ten. It gradually creates a sort of brief timeline of your life if you keep at it long enough.

100 Words

In the same vein, 100 Words is a site devoted to writing exactly that many words each day. No more, no less. It can be about whatever you want, but the word count is strictly enforced by a word counter that won’t let you go over.

The about page refers to the project as a “social tasking” site, whatever the hell that means. I read the entire page and I’m still not totally sure.

It helps you track your progress with a little monthly calendar that shows which days you’ve made an entry for and how close you are to meeting your word count goal for the month.

Scribophile

This creative writing community is kind of cool looking, and offers both a free and premium membership. They appear to use some sort of points system for users which allows them to perform certain actions, such as entering contests or posting their work.

In fact, their free membership is pretty limited to be honest. It looks like the paid version is probably worth the money for passionate fiction writers though, as they seem to offer plenty of goodies. The monthly subscription costs $9 and the yearly will set you back $65.

Figment

I haven’t had a chance to play around with Figment as much as I’d like yet, but so far I like it a lot. I’m probably more excited about this one than most of the others in this list, to be honest. 

It seems to have pretty much all the bells and whistles that Scribophile offers, but for free. For starters, you can browse other user stories, post your own, do story swaps with other writers, get access to tons of creative writing prompts, enter writing contests, post in the forum, join groups and much more.

It also seems to be considerably more social media friendly than the other sites mentioned here. You can sign up with your Twitter or Facebook account and it’s easy to connect both profiles to get the full social experience out of the whole thing. 

Authors and Social Media

A quick and very cool little story to end this with. As a teenager, I was a huge fan of Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles. I was recently taking a trip down memory lane and since I follow her on Facebook, I happened to see one of her posts recently and so I figured what the hell and posted a message to her wall, figuring she probably wouldn’t even end up reading it.

Not because I think she doesn’t read stuff fans send her, but because she has so many damn fans and so many people post to her wall that I figured it would get lost in the mix. A few moments later, she replied to it. I was pretty shocked. See below for a screenshot of the little exchange.

As you can see, people, she even thanked me for what I said. It’s the little things that count. If Anne Rice responds, none of us have an excuse. Of course, it could be her publicist. But something tells me it was her.

Having just recently released a prequel to my 2010 debut memoir in Amazon’s Kindle Store, I’ve been spending a lot of time reflecting on the writing process and my own style and techniques, which I will warn you are very unconventional.

Over the years, I’ve been given so many different pieces of writing advice going back as far as grade school. Admittedly, reaching the age of twenty-five hardly qualifies me as being seasoned or experienced, especially as a writer.

However, I have managed to make myself write a fair amount over the past seven years or so and at this point in time, I have made several of my own discoveries and managed to arrive at a few of my own conclusions about all the writing advice I’ve received so far.

So today, I’m setting out to share my list of the top three pieces of writing advice I have to offer anyone who writes anything at all. Please keep in mind that these are highly personal tidbits of my own and they are not going to work for everyone out there.

They won’t make sense for everyone and you won’t agree with all of them, or perhaps any of them. None of that matters, so don’t forget that. Trying to correct me here is impossible, as this is all very subjective stuff we’re discussing.

Stories Are Told, Not Shown

I started to keep a journal in 2005, when I was just barely eighteen years old. It was just a personal project and I wasn’t at all disciplined about it. I only wrote when I wanted to, which was oftentimes very infrequently. I kept telling myself it was okay if I didn’t write in it every day, or even every week. Something is better than nothing.

Fast forward five years, and I’m not really adding to he journal anymore. It’s basically gone into a dormant state, left untouched since it was first written.

Then something very unexpected happened that changed my life in many ways. I received an email from a man. He lived in the same state as I do and he claimed to be a published non-fiction author who I’d never heard of.

I looked his name up online and found out that he was legit. But why was he reaching out to contact me?

Well back when I was keeping the journal, I would post the occasional entries on my old blog that no longer exists today. He had stumbled upon the writing I posted there, and he believed I had a collective story that was worth publishing.

He even went as far as offering to help me lead the project and find a publisher for a small percentage of whatever deal we could land.

My first reaction was disbelief. Was this guy crazy? Could he even read?

Several emails later, he did admit to me that the writing needed what he called “a lot of work,” in terms of editing. That was absolutely true, especially if we hoped to find a publisher who might be interested in my story.

But that’s not what ended up happening. I did take his advice and send out a shitload of query letters to various agencies, only to get two requests for a sample and a long list of rejections.

Then, he told me about another possibility. He told me I could self-publish the book on Amazon to sell it for the Kindle device. I knew nothing about this or how it worked. He went on to point me in the right direction of some basic information and I was honestly intrigued.

Personally, I prefer to have full control over my writing and the content. I doubt I’m the type of person who would have taken it well if a publisher or editor wanted to make changes I didn’t agree with. So this Kindle stuff was sounding like a much better idea.

During one of my phone conversations with this author (he wishes to remain anonymous due to the subject matter of my writing) he offered me some writing advice that I have since come to disagree with, as a matter of personal preference.

He recommended that I buy a copy of this book, which he said contained a piece of writing advice that I needed to use in my own writing: “Show, don’t tell.“

Of course at first I figured I had better listen to this guy, as he probably knew much better than I did and had far more experience when it came to writing. I’m certainly not going to say that there is no value in this piece of advice, as I’m sure it has its place and is a rule worth following in many cases.

However, the way I have come to see things…they don’t call it storytelling for no reason. Stories are told, they are not shown.

I realized that my absolute favorite writing was written in a way that told me stuff, rather than trying to show it to me. I realize that there is a marked difference between the use of this in fiction and non-fiction. Maybe my preference is the result of favoring non-fiction and narrative style writing to fantasy or fiction novels.

Here is a great example of writing that I think is fucking awesome. This is one of my all time favorite blog posts from anywhere on the internet, and you’ll see it tells a very entertaining story without showing much (aside from the grotesque image, which you should be warned is NSFW).

There Are Absolutely No Fucking Rules

Lots of writers out there will strongly disagree with me for saying this, but I firmly stand my ground on this one.

What do I mean by this? Don’t there have to be at least some basic rules of writing to end up with something worth reading? In my own experience, no. Not really.

If you can put words together in a sequence that can at least be understood on some level by those who read them, then you can write. Very little else matters.

In my opinion, editing extremists and grammar gurus are way off base. Sure, editing does matter for some stuff like printed magazines or whatever the hell. But the level to which it is stressed to writers is a by-product of the snobbish attitude of many big name publishers.

For example, take this poem by e.e. cummings which is shown on the right. 

As you can see, the man refuses to capitalize his I’s, adds dashes where they don’t really belong, uses periods at the ends of some lines but not others, for some inexplicable reason adds spaces on either side of his ellipses, uses commas erratically and perhaps too much and pretty much does whatever the fuck he wants to do here.

Some people are definitely going to argue that this is poetry and therefore, some special set of rules applies. Please! If Mr. Cummings can write poetry however the hell he wants with no regard whatsoever for well established rules of writing, then guess what?

You can write whatever you write however you want to write it. Period. 

There is no wrong way to write whatever you’re setting out to write. If anyone tells you there is, don’t listen. Block them out. It’s good to listen to suggestions from others, but never listen when people start trying to tell you the “right” way to write. There simply isn’t one.

Your Writing Has an Audience, No Matter What

I don’t care what anyone says. The subjectivity of certain types of writing, such as poetry, illustrate this point quite well. What one reader sees as beautiful art, another discards and treats like pure garbage. 

If I sent you on a mission to find a single author or writer who has no fans at all, you’d be hard pressed to find one. If you don’t believe me, go look for one. Can you find just one writer who no one has ever praised at least once somewhere?

My guess is probably not. The explanation is simple. Regardless of what you write or how you choose to write it, you DO have an audience and they WILL both read and appreciate your work. No exceptions. 

If you go hunting for the writer with no fans, you’ll find that even those who were considered the greatest craftsmen of the pen in their time are both loved and hated, often close to equally. 

This is getting long, so let’s wrap this up shall we?

My Proof

I have proof that all of this advice can be true for some people. I have proof that they are true with my own writing. I know that the first item is true because I’m all about telling a story, and rarely do I “show” my readers anything…other than how to TELL a story, which is usually my own story.

I know the second item is true because of a couple horrifying facts that will probably make you faint. First, I have never even gone back to read my own journal in its entirety since I first wrote it. I didn’t have anyone else proofread or edit it either. I published it almost completely as-is. 

That’s right – just the way it was written originally. And yes, it IS somewhat of a mess because of that, which I’m perfectly fine with. All I did before publishing it on Amazon was run a simple spell checker.

And finally, I know the third item is true because since I published my “book” or “journal,” or whatever you want to call it, I have been contacted more times than I can count by a reader who found some meaning in those unedited pages and felt compelled to reach out either on Facebook, through email or some other platform.

Some of these people are now close friends of mine, in fact. They have shared their feedback and showed their support for my work, just the way it was written. So go write, people.

They were holding signs and hoping people would give them a few bucks out of pity or kindness or whatever inspires people to hand out money. My husband says, &quot;Man, I don&#039;t know if I could do that...I guess if they&#039;re willing to stand out there like that then they deserve the money they are given.&quot; I challenged him by asking if he really thought he couldn&#039;t bring himself to do that, and he said he was pretty sure he couldn&#039;t. He then tells me that I wouldn&#039;t either. &quot;Oh really?&quot; I replied. &quot;When we get home, write me a sign and I&#039;ll walk down there and hold it for an hour to prove you wrong.&quot; The cardboard sign he made for me read: &quot;Three kids, no job, husband left. Anything helps.&quot; I carried it down there and was a bit annoyed to find that all four freeway exits and on ramps were already quite occupied by other bums. I had to settle for the worst spot left. My husband came down about a half hour later and found me. He couldn&#039;t stop laughing. He asks how much money I made since I got there. &quot;Four fucking lousy dollars, not even enough for a pack of smokes.&quot; Most women who drove by gave me disgusted looks of disapproval and shook their heads. One person even yelled at me from their car, &quot;Go get a job!&quot; That made me laugh, which I tried to hide because it seemed out of character for my bum role. A couple guys stopped and gave me a buck or two and now I can say that yes, I&#039;ve begged for money before.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 1, 2013 at 6:38pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana added a new photo.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 1, 2013 at 12:31pm PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana likes a link on Coursera.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 1, 2013 at 11:09am PST</div><div class="comment">Don&#039;t get married to a hooker and then whine when she fucks other people.

A while back, I posted something about why it’s never a good idea to trash talk your competition. While it was intended to be humorous, the moral behind the story remains serious – don’t make yourself appear desperate and rather than wasting energy bashing on the competition, use it to improve your own products or services instead.

So today I wanted to discuss a few of the more “greyhat” or “shady” internet marketing practices I’ve encountered in the past couple of years. I’m sure there are endless others, so please be sure to share them in the comments if you’d like to make the list longer.

Forwarding New Subscribers to CPA Offers

This isn’t something I’ve seen many marketers use, presumably due to how ineffective I imagine it probably is. Well, at least in the “internet marketing” world. It may work better for offline marketing, I’m not entirely sure.

Basically, you subscribe to someone’s email list and when you receive the email confirmation message and click on the link inside, you are then forwarded to a CPA offer. For those of you who aren’t familiar, CPA stands for Cost-Per-Action and usually involves a short form asking for your name and ZIP code or email address in exchange for the promise of something for free.

It could be anything from a “FREE” gift card (which requires you to complete several PAID “offers” in order to receive it) to a free software download that comes with some form of advertising. See the screenshot below for an example of your typical CPA offer landing page.

 

Not that it’s particularly difficult even for the less than web savvy crowd to figure out on their own, CPA networks pay their affiliates each time someone successfully enters their information in a form like the one shown above.

Forwarding your new subscribers to a form like this is kind of a lame way to try and drive traffic UNLESS the offer directly relates to the list they are subscribing to, which isn’t likely and so far I haven’t found one case in which that is actually true.

Leaving Comments on Torrent Sites

Obviously torrent files are a highly controversial subject, with lots of heated opinions on both sides of the fence.

Some people swear that torrents are nothing but cheap schmucks and blackhat losers who want to pirate software instead of paying for it, while others stand their ground and believe that sharing files is everyone’s right and that big corporations charge ridiculously high prices to begin with.

Regardless of which side you find yourself on, I recently found a thread on the Warrior forum where someone shared a tip on using sites like The Pirate Bay to drive traffic to their site. I would link to the thread here, but it has unfortunately since been deleted.

Basically, this person said that you simply navigate to a popular torrent category on PB (I think the example he gave was “iphone apps” or something like that) and find torrents with lots of seeders (I think), then leave a relevant comment with a link to your site included as well. He or she claimed it was bringing in a small amount of traffic.

Of course, an argument ensued about the legitimacy of this method and I had to comment after a while. Pisses me off that it was deleted, there was a lot of good discussion on that thread. Oh well.

Submitting Referral Codes to BugMeNot

This one is certainly the most creative of the shady internet marketing practices listed here. Although it’s a little more difficult to pull off, for a couple of reasons.

First of all, BugMeNot.com is an interesting site which allows you to share your username and password for websites which force you to signup before you can view their content. Among the most popular examples listed on their homepage are sites like nytimes.com and even youtube.

The idea here is to share an unused, throw-away account that you made simply to access a website so that others don’t have to register if all they want to do is see something on the site.

It’s not meant for e-commerce sites, paid subscription sites or anything too commercial, for obvious reasons. Anything that requires a credit card is out and most of those types of websites are already blocked from the site. I imagine they are adding new ones to their blocked sites all the time, as new cases of abuse are brought to their attention.

However, I have noticed that there are some sites which people have added referral codes to instead of login details. By referral codes, I mean affiliates are posting codes which will earn them a commission when someone uses them to sign up for something.

For example, if you lookup Netspend.com on BugMeNot’s website, you will get more than one instance of something like what is pictured below this. As you can see, they simply entered “N/A” for both the username and password fields, and simply entered their referral code in the “other” field.

I’m surprised that BugMeNot hasn’t completely done away with this extra field, as I can’t think of any legitimate purpose for it to be perfectly honest.

While I have only been using WordPress to create websites and blogs for the past couple of years, I have managed to uncover what I consider a handful of extremely useful plugin gems.

In today’s post we’re going to cover my top 8 favorite WordPress plugins. While I don’t use all of these on this site, I DO use them on at least one of my sites or blogs and I have personal experience with each one.

Oh and before we get started, one more thing. I won’t be including many of what I consider to be the “essentials,” for WordPress, such as Askimet. Those should go without saying.

Bottom of Every Post

This is a nifty plugin which adds a block of content beneath each blog post. It’s incredibly simple and is edited by making changes to the bottom_of_every_post.txt file which loads in the editor from the plugins menu.

You can add custom HTML and create an opt-in box after each post, or you could display a banner ad. The possibilities are endless with this one. Want to see an example of the plugin in action? Check out this blog post from one of my other sites that uses this plugin by clicking here. See the nice box below the post?

This would be great for any blog in the IM niche, for obvious reasons. Great spot to place a call to action.

Social Linkz

With the sheer number of different social media plugins out there, trying to find the best one is a pain in the ass. After installing and testing out what seemed like a trillion, I have settled on this one as my favorite because it’s simple and functional and it works well.

Personally, I like to add &lt;center&gt; tags around the HTML in the plugin settings so that the social icons appear centered on the bottom of each page I include them on. Not much to say here, but you can see an example of the plugin at work by scrolling to the bottom of this post or any other page or post on this site.

WordPress Static HTML Output

This is an especially handy plugin, and there don’t seem to be many viable alternatives with similar functionality. Want to backup all the content from your WordPress site or blog? Install the plugin and it will generate static HTML files for all of your posts and pages.

This was really great for the websites I was no longer working on and which only needed a single sales page as a placeholder. What I did was create the sales page using OptimizePress, then I ran this plugin and simply uploaded the HTML version of the sales page to the main directory for my old, inactive sites. I was then able to simply uninstall WordPress for the sites I was no longer maintaining.

Two thumbs up for this one.

ScrapeAZon Plugin

This is a cool plugin which will scrape Amazon product reviews and display them on your site. This is a great tool for anyone who uses Amazon Associates and reviews products on their blog. In addition to having an Amazon Associates affiliate ID, you will also need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account.

Once you have one, you will need to provide your Access Key ID and your Secret Key in order to setup this plugin.

Once you’ve added those details, you simply insert a shortcode wherever you want reviews for a product to appear.

Single Post Message

This nifty plugin inserts a customized HTML block of content above specific blog posts. I used this on one of my other sites to include an Amazon widget featuring products related to one of my posts, and it looks very nice. Not much more to say here, but it’s cool in the same way that bottom of every post is, in my opinion.

Contact Form 7

While I did say I would stay away from essential plugins, I can’t help but include Contact Form 7 in this list. It’s tied for first place as my favorite WordPress plugin for creating contact forms, along with AJAX Contact. Both get my seal of approval for simplicity, flexibility and ease of use.

Google Sitemaps Generator

Last but not least, I had to include Google (XML) Sitemaps Generator plugin because it walks the fine line between awesome and essential. Obviously this is great for SEO and you absolutely must have a sitemap, which makes this addition pretty damn valuable.

Also, have to give props to WordPress SEO Plugin by Yoast for making it easy to optimize your WordPress content as you create it.

So which WordPress plugins are your favorites? Which ones did I leave out which are must-haves? Share in the comments.

So a while back, I started a little mini-series of posts on the core concepts of affiliate marketing. It was basically just a bit of my commentary regarding some of the most challenging aspects that newbies seem to face when trying to get started.

More recently, I expanded a bit on this topic by emphasizing the importance of making your affiliate offers unique in order to give them better chances at success. Since the last one began to drag on longer than I had planned, I decided to break it up and continue with a few additional observations in this post today.

Want to know what my other theories are about why you’re failing as a new affiliate?

We covered the possibility of your offer not standing out from the rest, but here are two more pieces of advice I have based on what I have learned so far.

Products Are Not Relevant

Plain and simple. You are failing because the products you are promoting are just not relevant to your niche, your site, your overall marketing style.

This could very well explain why it’s fairly important to choose a niche early on and stick with it, rather than let yourself lose focus and try ten different things at once.

Easier said than done, of course.

It’s probably like trying to choose a major when you start college. You may not be totally sure of what it is you want to focus on, which is normal. You can always change it later, or it may evolve on its own with little effort needed on your part. But the point is that just like a major, your niche isn’t set in stone.

But you do need one. Without one, you can’t really be making any progress towards a concrete goal, can you?

So what’s the take away from this mistake? If your website is about dog training, don’t push personal care products. Because those two things have basically nothing in common whatsoever. People who go to your site don’t want your recommendations on anything but what they came there for – dog training stuff.

Give them what they want and I’m guessing you’ll see an improvement in conversions almost immediately.

Does this mean you can’t also promote personal care stuff as an affiliate? Of course not. You just need to do it in the right place, where it is relevant. That could mean starting another site, but don’t end up with too many irons in the fire when you’re just starting out.

No Experience With Products

Okay, so maybe your affiliate products make sense wherever you happen to be promoting them. Great, that’s a good start!

But…have you ever used the stuff you’re trying to sell to other people? If the answer is no, there is a good chance this is part of the problem.

How many car salesmen have you encountered that had never driven the cars they were trying to sell you? Probably zero. On the contrary, they know the cars they are selling quite well and can answer any question about them in most cases.

They take you on a test drive to show you everything about the car that there is to love, in the hopes that you agree and buy the damned thing, right? Well affiliate marketing should not be much different.

The point is, who would buy a car from someone who had simply read a few paragraphs about it before trying to sell it? No one! They could do that on their own, the salesman offers zero value if that’s all he can bring to the table.

Same goes for affiliate stuff. You need to have firsthand experience with all the products you are promoting if you want to actually succeed. You must know what the hell you’re talking about, or no one will buy any of it.

Does this mean you have to buy every product you want to promote? No, not really. In fact, many product creators are more than willing to provide you with a review copy if you contact them as a serious marketer who is interested in promoting their stuff if it passes your quality check. And by the way, never promote anything which doesn’t either.

So these are just the opinions of someone who is relatively new to all of this herself. Anyone else have anything to add to this? Please share in comments.

Well, I guess we&#039;re going to find out...

Had job interview this afternoon for &quot;appointment setter&quot; position. Basically, telemarketing. Seems to be the most challenging type of sales there is, but I don&#039;t like doing things the easy way so I guess that fits. 

It will be interesting to see which way it goes. Wish me luck.

Get old fashioned and carry a fucking pen and notepad with you AT ALL TIMES. 

I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re a writer or not. It doesn&#039;t matter one bit. 

You need to have something with you wherever you go that allows you to record important thoughts and ideas RIGHT as you are having them. Otherwise you will risk losing them forever.

When you wake up from a dream that you can&#039;t seem to shake, for fuck&#039;s sake write it down immediately before it escapes you. 

This is it, folks...this is life. Perhaps the only one we ever get. Make it count. Write it down. Highlight your favorite parts. Don&#039;t leave anything out.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, December 28, 2012 at 7:37pm PST</div><div class="comment">Remember that every person who you come into contact to on any given day has a story that is probably far more amazing than you will imagine and no one is going to just offer up their entire life&#039;s worth of experiences to you because you want them to. 

It takes time to draw someone&#039;s story out from within them. It takes trust. It takes sincerity and dedication. 

Keep in mind that each and every interaction you have with all those people on a daily basis is a unique opportunity to develop any kind of relationship with that person that the two of you might want to be a part of. 

It doesn&#039;t matter how you meet them or what it is that you do with them. 

It can be as mundane as waving to them in the morning as they leave their driveway, or it can be as huge as saving someone&#039;s life in a moment of uncertainty and sacrifice. 

Each person has the potential to become a friend or a lover or to simply teach you something important and then slip back into the endless rush of other bodies moving about the planet around us. 

Don&#039;t pass these chances up too often, or you&#039;ll get lost in the tide yourself.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 27, 2012 at 9:13am PST</div><div class="comment">Heading to airport in Palm Springs at 11:00 am.

People tell me to let go of shit and I say fuck that. They tell me I&#039;ll be a happier person if I do, and I say wanna bet? 

I have every right to be mad about the things I&#039;m mad about. I am not ready to let them go, so why should I? I&#039;m basically kind of an unhappy person either way, so why let anyone who has betrayed me get off easy? 

People seem to forget that I&#039;m actually very forgiving when I feel that a person deserves to be forgiven. To me, that means learning from your mistakes and not repeating them when your actions are hurtful to others. 

Not willing to do that? Then fuck forgiveness. And fuck you. 

See, the nice thing about having a moody and depressed personality is that it transfers into all other areas of my life. When I love, I love deeper than most others. When I care, it keeps me up at night. When I reach out, I offer anything I can to help. 

Oftentimes these things are unnoticed or no one gives a shit. But you know what? I&#039;m going to hate who and what I feel deserve to be hated until my mind is changed about them. That isn&#039;t very likely.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 19, 2012 at 9:18am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana played a word in Words With Friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 19, 2012 at 7:07am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 19, 2012 at 1:14am PST</div><div class="comment">Years 2005 - 2012 (in HDR style).

I want to know why the hell Facebook censored this when I shared it several months ago. I posted it on Google+ and it hasn&#039;t seemed to cause any trouble there. I mean, Facebook users control what they see and do not see on the site...so why would they censor stuff like this (which is obviously not pornography, but rather a single pornographic image within a larger image for the sake of illustrating a point) when presumably, anyone who sees it has chosen to be my friend or subscriber and is free to simply unfriend or unsubscribe?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, December 13, 2012 at 8:48pm PST</div><div class="comment">I don&#039;t know why love is so important to everyone.

I want so badly to talk to you,
But I feel even more empty when I do.
So here I sit, unable to stop the tears.
They just keep coming, pouring out and dripping off my face.
As if they were waiting
All the time
Just beneath the surface.
Ready to burst out at any moment.
Like a dam that has broken,
I can&#039;t stop them.
How can I feel so alone when there are this many people
Around me?
The truth is, I am scared.
And honestly, I have nothing left.
Seems like I count every breath
Thinking it&#039;s only one closer to the last one I&#039;ll take.
What does my life mean? Nothing, really. 
When will this be over? 
Life is little more than one happiness
Followed by sadness
Over and over again
Until the end.
That&#039;s all it is.
They say this too shall pass,
Fuck I hope it does soon.
I feel like I&#039;m losing my mind
And knowing myself
Like no one else really does
It seems it might actually happen.
I don&#039;t want to drag anyone else down with me,
And that&#039;s probably all I would do
If I were to open up to you
Or probably anyone else
So I&#039;ll sit here all the rest of tonight
And tomorrow
And who knows how long
Keeping it to myself
Failing to stay strong.
I just hope it is over soon.
Seems so much harder to survive
The sadness than it once was.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, November 23, 2012 at 2:40am PST</div>Ashly Lorenzana shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, November 22, 2012 at 9:42pm PST</div><div class="comment">Okay...I think it&#039;s obvious that in the past couple of years, online advertisements have fucking literally taken over free game sites and tons of other shit on the internet that can&#039;t be monetized in any other way (Facebook included). 

Though the ads on free services like Gmail (or even Facebook) are unobtrusive and subtle. You often don&#039;t notice them at all or realize they are even there. 

But I noticed something hilarious about a lot of newer video ads I&#039;ve been seeing on different sites...there is a nifty PAUSE feature. Who the fuck would pause an annoying ass advertisement??? What, are they going to run to the bathroom and rush back so they can hit play and check out an ad for HOLIDAY ZIP LOCK bags, for fuck&#039;s sake? 

The awesome thing is that pausing the ad essentially allows you to not have to sit through it. No sound, no stupid visuals. Just silence until the game starts. 

Fuck ads. So much for trying new and innovative dumbass shit like putting a pause button on your ad, as if anyone wants to watch it that fucking bad.

So earlier today, I somehow managed to accidentally click some link that took me to a rather hideous promotional page promoting Microsoft’s search engine – Bing.

Here is a screenshot (click the image for full-size if you can’t read the text):

Now, I don’t know anything about this legal case at all. In fact, this was the first I had heard about it at all. First sign that it’s not nearly as noteworthy as Microsoft would like for us to believe it was.

However, I don’t need to know the details to come to one clear conclusion: Microsoft is trash talking Google and in doing so is hoping that more people will use Bing when searching the web.

I don’t know about you, but this is pretty ineffective in my mind. And it really only backfires, especially when people who can think for themselves read this kind of crap.

Here are a few reasons why this kind of marketing sucks.

Name Calling Sucks

And sorry, but that’s exactly what this sounds like. It’s fine to use fear in marketing. In fact, I would argue that just about anything you’re trying to sell should be marketed with some amount of fear. Fear of something, whether it be an outcome or whatever else.

Basically the idea is to convince people that life without the product is so bad that they should be afraid of the very possibility and buy immediately.

All that is fine and good. Newspapers are masterful at this, just go grab one and read the headlines. Which ones are the most urgent and frightening? There you go.

BUT – this approach is totally ruined when you start name calling. Microsoft could easily have inspired fear regarding the invasion of privacy without pointing fingers at Google.

Honestly, if the court case was nearly as ground-breaking as they want us to think, then wouldn’t it stand to reason that most of the general public (who watch the News and shit) would pick up on the implied connection between the promo and the recent court ruling?

Mmm Hmm.

Appearing Desperate Sucks

Sorry, but my first thought after seeing this was that perhaps Microsoft is a bit SCARED themselves.

Could this screenshot have anything to do with their name calling strategy…?

I think it’s a good possibility.

Chrome has managed to grab more browser market share than Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. And Google has always had the most market share when it comes to their search engine.

I guess Microsoft is none too happy about this. They must think their only hope lies in bashing on Google and convincing people that they are bad guys.

The Odds Are Against You

When you’re setting out to position yourself above the competition, you should…shouldn’t you, um, actually be better than them to begin with?

Sorry, but if the fact is that more people are choosing to use Google’s browser and their search engine, then that means they already have more people on their side, so to speak. Microsoft better hope that people are going to change their minds over a single court case that honestly affected like zero people in any real measurable way.

I doubt this.

Besides, Microsoft has been taken to court a few times throughout its history as well…as have many large corporations. This isn’t unusual.

You Piss off Fans of the Competition

Okay, this is the biggest reason why you should probably not trash talk your competitors for your own gain…you piss off passionate fans of said competition and they create a spoof like the one I couldn’t resist hacking together in GIMP after seeing this bull shit.

Here is my version (click on it to enlarge):

Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. But in all seriousness, what are your thoughts on using this type of strategy in your marketing? Yay, nay? Why is it or isn’t it cool? Share in the comments.

I like to share the best free resources with my readers so that they can get started with their online marketing ventures TODAY, instead of putting them off and making excuses.

Let’s face it – we all start out strapped for cash and basically without a clue in the beginning, right?

Exactly.

Which is why there is nothing wrong with leveraging free resources to get your business going. There is no shame in making good use of high-quality freebies to establish yourself.

It is relatively painless to upgrade to paid services or replacements later on, but I don’t think you should be too worried about that at this point.

I’ve blogged in the past about free email marketing tools and various other entrepreneurial tools in the hopes that my readers would find something that works for them. Today, we’re going to take a quick look at my top five free tools for internet marketing newbies.

This is Google’s URL shortening service and it’s very useful for tracking clicks on most types of links you share on social networks and other places. Beware – this won’t work for Clickbank links! However, it’s a damn good measuring tool for most other links. Not sure why Google has put the hate on the CB affiliate links, but they sure don’t seem to like them.

It does, however, work for smaller programs and I use it to track clicks on my affiliate and referral links in my Squidoo lenses. It shows you lots of useful info, like all the referring sites and total number of clicks.

Free Graphic Creator

This is a really cool generator that makes it quick, easy and painless to create marketing graphics. Generate headline graphics, buy now buttons, guarantee certificates and much more with this free and priceless tool! This can really help to add a more professional look and feel to your first sales pages.

Screenr

This is a really neat screencast recording service that allows you to record up to five minutes per screen cast. The uses for this are unlimited. Use it to create quick five minute tutorial videos and upload them directly to your Youtube account. Also has options for downloading the mp4 files as well.

Marketing Grader

This amazing tool from Hubspot will help you optimize your website for search engines, suggest improvements for your blog, give you insight on keywords and tell you which high pagerank sites are linking to you. This is a veritable treasure chest of important metrics for your website. Follow their advice, it is golden! It will even let you compare your score with competing websites, if you want to add a couple.

Feedburner

Not quite ready to pay for an autoresponder service for your email marketing? Feedburner is a great free alternative that will serve the same basic function while allowing you to collect subscribers and build a following. Offers email subscriptions in addition to RSS updates, expanding your readership and alerting your followers each time you post new blog content.

Did you know that unlike Google AdWords, you can use direct affiliate links to create ads on Facebook? That means you don’t need your own landing page or website to make money with PPC ads on Facebook.

While a little money to get started is necessary, it’s not much and you can start making money pretty quickly since Facebook provides so much information about people and what they are interested in. 

Trust me on this one, I know. Why? Because I have fallen for it myself.

I’m a huge fan of the show Breaking Bad, which I have added to my favorite shows on my Facebook profile. Awhile back, a company called TeeFury ran a Facebook ad for a limited edition t-shirt design featuring the two main characters from the show. They were only ten bucks too!

I immediately clicked and bought one before even thinking twice. I thought it was super cool, in fact.

That really opened my eyes to how powerful Facebook ads can really be. Since they know what people like, your job as an affiliate marketer is pretty easy.

While you can’t promote products in the “make money” niches, you can create highly targeted ads for paid products that relate to people’s hobbies and interests.

I still don&#039;t want to have any myself, but I think it dawned on me why most people want them and do have them: it&#039;s kind of scary having no one to live for, and it gets more frightening as you age. Traveling through life alone is pretty dark and depressing for most people. I&#039;ll admit that at times it certainly can be, but I think I can handle it and I have no plans of looking back.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, October 28, 2012 at 5:18am PDT</div>Ashly Lorenzana added Portland, Oregon as her hometown.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, October 26, 2012 at 9:09am PDT</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, October 25, 2012 at 9:21pm PDT</div><div class="comment">Why the hell can you &quot;like&quot; your own stuff on Facebook?!
